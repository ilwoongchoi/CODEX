Psoriasis as a Dermal Lymphatic Clearance Failure: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Psoriasis as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Psoriasis is a Dermal Lymphatic Clearance Failure. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Cutaneous Hyper-Proliferation via Lymphatic Stasis. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Lymphatic Clearance (The Drain)

Protocol: Sarsaparilla (Saponins) + Sweat Therapy.
Mechanism: Psoriatic plaques form where endotoxins accumulate in the skin. Saponins bind gut endotoxins, preventing their absorption. Sweating forces the dermal lymphatic fluid to move, clearing the toxic stagnancy.

1.2 Target 2: The Keratinocyte Cycle (Differentiation)

Protocol: High-Dose Vitamin D (Topical/Oral).
Mechanism: Vitamin D is a potent pro-differentiation hormone. It forces the rapidly dividing keratinocytes to stop proliferating and mature, flattening the plaque.

1.3 Target 3: The Bile Flow (Hepatic Clearance)

Protocol: TUDCA + Bile Salts.
Mechanism: The skin acts as a 'Third Kidney'. When the Liver/Bile pathway is clogged, toxins are dumped into the skin. TUDCA thins the bile, reopening the primary detoxification route.

2. Conclusion

Psoriasis is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Lymphatic Clearance (The Drain), The Keratinocyte Cycle (Differentiation), and The Bile Flow (Hepatic Clearance), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
