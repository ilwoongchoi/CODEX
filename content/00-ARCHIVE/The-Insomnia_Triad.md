Insomnia as a Failure of the Sleep-Onset Cooling Mechanism: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Insomnia as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Insomnia is a Failure of the Sleep-Onset Cooling Mechanism. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Hyper-Arousal via Cortical Overheating. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Thermal Switch (Cooling)

Protocol: Warm Bath 90min before bed (The Rebound Drop).
Mechanism: Sleep requires a 1°C drop in core body temperature. A warm bath dilates peripheral vessels. When you get out, heat rapidly dumps from the core to the skin, triggering the 'Cooling Signal' that initiates sleep.

1.2 Target 2: The Stress Hormone (Cortisol)

Protocol: Phosphatidylserine (PS) + Ashwagandha.
Mechanism: Insomniacs have high nocturnal cortisol (The 'Tired but Wired' state). PS blunts the ACTH response, physically lowering cortisol levels and allowing the melatonin wave to take over.

1.3 Target 3: The Safety Signal (GABA)

Protocol: Weighted Blanket + Glycine.
Mechanism: Proprioceptive pressure (Weighted Blanket) stimulates the Vagus Nerve, shifting the autonomic state from Sympathetic (Fight) to Parasympathetic (Rest). Glycine lowers body temperature and acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

2. Conclusion

Insomnia is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Thermal Switch (Cooling), The Stress Hormone (Cortisol), and The Safety Signal (GABA), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
