Vertigo (BPPV Meniere's) as a Endolymphatic Pressure Dysregulation: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Vertigo (BPPV Meniere's) as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Vertigo (BPPV Meniere's) is a Endolymphatic Pressure Dysregulation. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Vestibular Hydrops and Crystal Displacement. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Fluid Pressure (The Hydrops)

Protocol: Betahistine (H3 Antagonist) + Low Sodium.
Mechanism: Meniere's is 'Glaucoma of the Ear'. Fluid pressure builds up. Betahistine increases blood flow to the Stria Vascularis, facilitating fluid reabsorption.

1.2 Target 2: The Crystal Stability (Otoliths)

Protocol: Vitamin D + K2.
Mechanism: The 'Crystals' (Otoliths) are made of Calcium Carbonate. Vitamin D/K2 regulates calcium metabolism. Deficiency leads to 'loose crystals' that detach and float into the canals.

1.3 Target 3: The Mechanical Reset (The Maneuver)

Protocol: Epley Maneuver (Canalith Repositioning).
Mechanism: A physics-based solution. Using gravity to roll the loose crystals out of the semicircular canal and back into the utricle where they belong.

2. Conclusion

Vertigo (BPPV Meniere's) is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Fluid Pressure (The Hydrops), The Crystal Stability (Otoliths), and The Mechanical Reset (The Maneuver), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
