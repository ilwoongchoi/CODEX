Erectile Dysfunction as a Endothelial Dysfunction in the Cavernosum: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Erectile Dysfunction as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Erectile Dysfunction is a Endothelial Dysfunction in the Cavernosum. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Hydraulic Failure via Nitric Oxide Deficit. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Gas (Nitric Oxide)

Protocol: L-Citrulline + Beetroot.
Mechanism: The erection is hydraulic. The valve is opened by Nitric Oxide (NO). Citrulline recycles into Arginine -> NO, maximizing the fill pressure.

1.2 Target 2: The Vessel Elasticity (Compliance)

Protocol: Vitamin K2 + Vitamin D.
Mechanism: Calcified arteries cannot expand. K2 moves calcium out of the artery walls and into the bone, restoring the elasticity required for engorgement.

1.3 Target 3: The Venous Leak (The Seal)

Protocol: Pelvic Floor Training (Kegels/Reverse Kegels).
Mechanism: The erection is maintained by compressing the outflow veins against the Tunica Albuginea. Strong Ischiocavernosus muscles act as the 'Clamp' to hold the blood in.

2. Conclusion

Erectile Dysfunction is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Gas (Nitric Oxide), The Vessel Elasticity (Compliance), and The Venous Leak (The Seal), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
