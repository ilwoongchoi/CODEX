Fibromyalgia as a Neuro-Inflammatory Wind-Up: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Fibromyalgia as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Fibromyalgia is a Neuro-Inflammatory Wind-Up. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Central Sensitization via Glial Activation. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Glial Cell (The Amplifier)

Protocol: Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN).
Mechanism: Fibromyalgia pain is not in the muscle; it is in the brain. Microglia are activated and pumping excitatory cytokines. LDN temporarily blocks opioid receptors, causing a rebound increase in Endorphins which act as a 'Reset Signal' to calm the microglia.

1.2 Target 2: The Mitochondrial Energy (The Muscle Pain)

Protocol: D-Ribose + Magnesium Malate.
Mechanism: Fibro muscles are hypoxic and ATP-depleted. D-Ribose bypasses the rate-limiting step of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, rapidly restoring ATP pools in the muscle tissue.

1.3 Target 3: The Fascial Tension (The Suit)

Protocol: Myofascial Release (John F. Barnes Method).
Mechanism: Chronic sympathetic freeze response tightens the fascia (The Suit). This physical compression stimulates mechanoreceptors, creating a constant background noise of 'Danger' that sensitizes the central nervous system.

2. Conclusion

Fibromyalgia is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Glial Cell (The Amplifier), The Mitochondrial Energy (The Muscle Pain), and The Fascial Tension (The Suit), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
