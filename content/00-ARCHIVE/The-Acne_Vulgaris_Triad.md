Acne Vulgaris as a Hyper-Keratinization and Lipid Peroxidation: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Acne Vulgaris as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Acne Vulgaris is a Hyper-Keratinization and Lipid Peroxidation. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Follicular Occlusion via Sebum Oxidation. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Sebum Quality (Liquefaction)

Protocol: Pantothenic Acid (B5) High Dose.
Mechanism: B5 increases Coenzyme A, which is required to break down fats. High dose B5 forces the metabolism of sebum lipids, thinning the oil so it doesn't clog the pore.

1.2 Target 2: The Oxidation (The Blackhead Trigger)

Protocol: Vitamin E + NAC.
Mechanism: Sebum only clogs the pore when Squalene oxidizes (Squalene Peroxide). Antioxidants prevent this oxidation, keeping the sebum fluid and non-comedogenic.

1.3 Target 3: The Keratin Plug (The Cork)

Protocol: Topical Retinoids (Vitamin A).
Mechanism: Retinoids normalize follicular keratinization, preventing the 'sticky' dead skin cells from forming the plug that traps the bacteria.

2. Conclusion

Acne Vulgaris is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Sebum Quality (Liquefaction), The Oxidation (The Blackhead Trigger), and The Keratin Plug (The Cork), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
