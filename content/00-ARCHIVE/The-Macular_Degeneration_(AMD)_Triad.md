Macular Degeneration (AMD) as a Bruch's Membrane Transport Failure: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Macular Degeneration (AMD) as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a Bruch's Membrane Transport Failure. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Retinal Starvation via Waste Accumulation (Drusen). We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Waste Cleaner (Drusen)

Protocol: Apigenin (CD38 Inhibitor) + NAD+ Precursors.
Mechanism: Drusen accumulation is a failure of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) to digest photoreceptor waste. Increasing NAD+ levels rejuvenates the RPE mitochondria, restoring phagocytic capacity.

1.2 Target 2: The Photoprotection (Blue Light Shield)

Protocol: Lutein + Zeaxanthin (20mg/4mg).
Mechanism: These carotenoids accumulate in the macula, forming a physical 'Internal Sunglasses' layer that absorbs high-energy blue light before it can oxidize the photoreceptors.

1.3 Target 3: The Blood Flow (Choroidal Perfusion)

Protocol: Nitrate-Rich Diet (Beets/Arugula).
Mechanism: The Choroid has the highest blood flow per gram in the body. Nitric Oxide maintains this flow. Reduced flow leads to hypoxia and VEGF release (Wet AMD). Nitrates prevent this ischemic trigger.

2. Conclusion

Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Waste Cleaner (Drusen), The Photoprotection (Blue Light Shield), and The Blood Flow (Choroidal Perfusion), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
