Endometriosis as a Peritoneal Macrophage Clearance Defect: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Endometriosis as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Endometriosis is a Peritoneal Macrophage Clearance Defect. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Retrograde Menstruation via Peritoneal Immune Failure. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Macrophage Scavenger (The Cleaner)

Protocol: N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) + Resveratrol.
Mechanism: Endometriosis occurs when peritoneal macrophages fail to eat the refluxed endometrial tissue. NAC reduces the oxidative stress that paralyzes these macrophages, reactivating their phagocytic drive.

1.2 Target 2: The Estrogen Dominance (The Fuel)

Protocol: Calcium-D-Glucarate + DIM.
Mechanism: Endometrial tissue is Estrogen-dependent. Calcium-D-Glucarate inhibits Beta-Glucuronidase, preventing the re-absorption of excreted estrogen from the gut, effectively lowering the total estrogen load.

1.3 Target 3: The Pelvic Circulation (Venous Decongestion)

Protocol: Mayan Abdominal Massage / Castor Oil Packs.
Mechanism: Pelvic congestion creates a hypoxic environment that stimulates angiogenesis (new vessel growth) for the lesions. Physical mobilization increases venous return, oxygenating the tissue and inhibiting VEGF.

2. Conclusion

Endometriosis is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Macrophage Scavenger (The Cleaner), The Estrogen Dominance (The Fuel), and The Pelvic Circulation (Venous Decongestion), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
