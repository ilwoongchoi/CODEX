Viral-Induced Excitation-Inhibition Imbalance: A Metabolic Framework for Neuropsychiatric Sequelae in Long COVID

Abstract
Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) presents a clinical paradox wherein patients exhibit simultaneous hyperarousal (anxiety, insomnia) and metabolic exhaustion (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction). Current neuroinflammatory models describe these symptoms in isolation but lack a unified mechanism explaining their co-occurrence. This paper proposes that persistent viral-induced inflammation disrupts the activity of Glutamate Decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for converting excitatory glutamate into inhibitory GABA. We hypothesize that the sequestration of metabolic cofactors (specifically Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate) and cytokine-mediated downregulation of GAD1 expression creates a "locked" hyper-glutamatergic state. This results in a functional "Metabolic Schizophrenia," where the brain is electrically overactive yet bioenergetically depleted. This framework identifies the restoration of GAD67 enzymatic function as a primary therapeutic target.

1. Introduction: The "Tired but Wired" Paradox

The neuropsychiatric burden of Long COVID affects a significant proportion of survivors, characterized by a debilitating cycle of "tired but wired" symptoms (1). Patients frequently report an inability to initiate sleep or achieve relaxation despite profound physical exhaustion. This phenomenological experience mirrors a specific failure of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) to transition from a catabolic, high-energy state (Sympathetic) to an anabolic, restorative state (Parasympathetic).

Recent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ($^1$H-MRS) studies have validated this clinical observation, demonstrating significantly reduced cortical GABA levels and elevated Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx) ratios in PASC patients compared to healthy controls (2). While these findings confirm an Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) imbalance, the upstream driver of this imbalance remains under-characterized. We propose that this dysregulation is not merely a downstream effect of general brain damage, but a specific failure of the enzymatic "brake" mechanism: Glutamate Decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) (3).

2. The Mechanism: GAD67 Failure and the Glutamate Trap

In a healthy homeostatic system, the brain manages energy expenditure through the balance of glutamate (excitation) and GABA (inhibition). GAD67 is the constitutive enzyme responsible for over 90% of basal GABA synthesis, maintaining the "tonic inhibition" required for neural stability (4).

2.1 The Enzymatic Bottleneck (Apoenzyme vs. Holoenzyme)

GAD67 is not a static protein; it is a highly dynamic enzyme that oscillates between an inactive "apoenzyme" state and an active "holoenzyme" state. This transition is strictly dependent on the binding of its cofactor, Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate (PLP), the active form of Vitamin B6. Structural characterization of GAD67 has definitively shown that its catalytic loop is only active when bound to PLP; without this cofactor, the enzyme remains structurally locked and inactive (4).

We propose that in PASC, this conversion process is rate-limited by cofactor availability. If GAD67 cannot function, glutamate—the substrate—accumulates in the synapse.

2.2 The Hyper-Glutamatergic State ("Wired")

The failure of conversion leads to a synaptic accumulation of glutamate. This drives the sympathetic nervous system into a state of chronic overdrive, manifesting clinically as anxiety, tachycardia, and insomnia (5). The patient is chemically "locked" in sympathetic dominance because the metabolic pathway required to synthesize the "parasympathetic signal" (GABA) is mechanically blocked at the enzymatic level.

2.3 GABA Depletion and Mitochondrial Exhaustion ("Tired")

Simultaneously, the failure to synthesize GABA deprives the brain of tonic inhibition. Without GABA to dampen neural firing, neural circuits continue to fire at high frequency, consuming Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) at an unsustainable rate. This "neural friction" leads to rapid mitochondrial exhaustion, experienced by the patient as profound cognitive fatigue or "brain fog" (6). The brain effectively operates like an engine revving at maximum RPM in neutral—burning fuel rapidly without achieving restorative function.

3. Viral Drivers of Enzymatic Failure

The dysfunction of GAD67 in PASC can be attributed to a "Perfect Storm" of three convergent viral mechanisms: metabolic theft, mitochondrial hijacking, and transcriptional suppression.

3.1 Viral Sequestration of PLP (The Kynurenine Trap)

Viral replication and the associated hyper-inflammatory response place an immense demand on host metabolic resources. Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly alters host one-carbon metabolism and cofactor availability (7). Crucially, the immune response activates the Kynurenine Pathway to degrade tryptophan (an antiviral defense). This pathway is heavily PLP-dependent, specifically the enzymes kynureninase and kynurenine aminotransferase (14).

Because kynureninase and kynurenine aminotransferase are PLP-dependent enzymes with high turnover during chronic immune activation, sustained kynurenine pathway flux creates a competitive drain on systemic PLP pools. In the context of blood-brain barrier transport limitations and local inflammatory signaling, this systemic depletion translates into a CNS-specific cofactor deficit that disproportionately affects GAD67, which has a relatively low affinity for PLP compared to other PLP-dependent enzymes (13, 9).

We hypothesize that the chronic immune activation seen in Long COVID creates a systemic "sink" for PLP, diverting it away from the central nervous system to fuel the immune response. This creates a functional "famine" for GAD67. Even if the enzyme protein is present, it remains in its inactive apoenzyme form due to the lack of PLP (8). This aligns with findings that Vitamin B6 deficiency is common in severe COVID-19 outcomes and is linked to pro-inflammatory cytokine storms (9).

3.2 Mitochondrial Hijacking and the Glutamate Backlog

SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to directly hijack host mitochondria to facilitate viral replication, downregulating core mitochondrial genes and impairing oxidative phosphorylation (15). Dysfunctional mitochondria cannot effectively process glutamate through the TCA cycle (via Glutamate Dehydrogenase). This metabolic block causes intracellular glutamate levels to rise even further. This creates a vicious cycle: elevated cytosolic glutamate ordinarily signals increased demand for GAD67 activity to maintain E/I balance, but the simultaneous PLP depletion leaves GAD67 unable to respond. The result is a functional bottleneck where substrate (glutamate) accumulates upstream of a disabled enzyme (GAD67), compounding the excitotoxic burden. This places an impossible burden on GAD67 to clear the excess---at the exact moment GAD67 is disabled by PLP deficiency (14, 15).

3.3 Neuroinflammatory Downregulation of GAD1

Beyond cofactor theft, the inflammatory milieu itself directly impacts enzyme expression. Chronic neuroinflammation, characterized by elevated TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6, has been shown to transcriptionally downregulate GAD1, the gene encoding GAD67 (10). This creates a pathogenic feed-forward loop:

This creates a pathogenic feed-forward loop with specific molecular steps:

Inflammation (elevated TNF-α, IL-6) transcriptionally downregulates GAD1 expression through NF-κB-mediated suppression of GAD67 promoter activity (10).

Reduced GABA synthesis depletes tonic GABAergic signaling to both neurons and immune cells. Microglia and peripheral immune cells express functional GABA-A receptors; GABA binding normally suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine release through chloride-mediated hyperpolarization (11).

Loss of GABAergic immune dampening allows unopposed excitatory signaling to amplify cytokine production, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where inflammation further suppresses the very system (GAD67) needed to resolve it (10, 11).

4. Therapeutic Implications

Current management of PASC often relies on serotonergic agents (SSRIs) or non-specific sedatives, which do not address the underlying enzymatic failure. This framework suggests a targeted metabolic approach to "restart" the GAD67 enzyme:

4.1 Cofactor Restoration (PLP)

High-dose supplementation with the bioactive form of Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate, 50-100 mg daily) is proposed to saturate the GAD67 apoenzyme and drive it into its active holoenzyme conformation. Standard pyridoxine (inactive B6) may be insufficient in Long COVID because the inflammatory milieu impairs the kinase enzymes required to convert pyridoxine → PLP (17). Direct PLP supplementation bypasses this metabolic block and provides immediate cofactor availability to the CNS. This approach requires clinical validation but is mechanistically grounded in the established PLP-dependence of GAD67 catalytic activity (4, 17).

4.2 Magnesium as the Stabilizer

Magnesium is a critical stabilizer of the ATP-PLP binding complex; its deficiency is frequently comorbid with B6 deficiency and exacerbates excitotoxicity by removing the magnesium block on NMDA (glutamate) receptors. Correcting magnesium status is essential to allow GAD67 to function and to protect neurons from the accumulated glutamate (17).

4.3 Reducing the Glutamate Load

Reducing the total glutamate load through nutritional or pharmacological means may allow mitochondrial function to recover, resolving the fatigue component (18).

5. Conclusion

Long COVID neuropsychiatric symptoms represent a specific "Metabolic Schizophrenia"—a functional disconnection between the brain's energy supply and its inhibitory control systems. By identifying the GAD67-PLP axis as the central failure point, we resolve the paradox of simultaneous fatigue and anxiety. The virus has not just damaged the brain; it has hijacked the metabolic cofactors required to apply the brake. Restoring this enzymatic function offers a logical, mechanistically sound path to recovery.
