Glaucoma (Low Tension) as a Trans-Lamina Cribrosa Pressure Gradient Failure: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Glaucoma (Low Tension) as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Glaucoma (Low Tension) is a Trans-Lamina Cribrosa Pressure Gradient Failure. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Optic Nerve Stroke via Pressure Differential. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Pressure Differential (CSF vs IOP)

Protocol: Avoid Head-Down Yoga; Sleep with Head Elevated.
Mechanism: The Optic Nerve is damaged when Intraocular Pressure (IOP) > Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure (CSFP). If CSFP is too low, even normal eye pressure causes damage. Keeping the head up maintains the gradient.

1.2 Target 2: The Mitochondrial Shield (Axonal Support)

Protocol: Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) High Dose.
Mechanism: Glaucoma is a metabolic crisis of the Ganglion Cell. High dose B3 prevents the depletion of NAD+, making the nerve robust against pressure-induced stress.

1.3 Target 3: The Vascular Autoregulation

Protocol: Magnesium + Ginkgo Biloba.
Mechanism: Low Tension Glaucoma patients have vasospasm (cold hands/feet). Magnesium relaxes the ophthalmic artery, ensuring the nerve gets blood even when pressure is applied.

2. Conclusion

Glaucoma (Low Tension) is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Pressure Differential (CSF vs IOP), The Mitochondrial Shield (Axonal Support), and The Vascular Autoregulation, we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
