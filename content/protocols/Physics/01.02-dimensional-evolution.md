# The Neurotransmitter Evolutionary Sequence

## 1. The GABA Solution (4:30 PM)
The glutamate state was unsustainable. The accumulated charge within early protocells created a positive feedback loop: more UV exposure → more glutamate → more charge accumulation. The first major evolutionary innovation was the discovery of **controlled discharge** via decarboxylation:

**Glutamate → GABA + CO₂** (catalyzed by GAD, requiring PLP)

This reaction is thermodynamically irreversible. By sacrificing the gamma-carboxyl group (releasing CO₂), the molecule **loses its dipole**. GABA possesses only a single carboxyl group, making it electrochemically **neutral**. This neutrality is the essence of **inhibition**. GABA does not "turn off" neurons; it **removes the driving force** for excitation.

## 2. The Cosmic Ray Alternative (6:00 PM)
The ionotropic GABA-A receptor (Right GABA) solved the daytime crisis—how to endure direct solar bombardment. But it created **rigidity**. The breakthrough came at sunset, when the dominant ionizing radiation shifted from solar UV to galactic cosmic rays.

Cosmic ray bombardment produced **alkaline conditions** (high pH). This pH difference fundamentally altered GABA structure. The "Left GABA" (metabotropic GABA-B) that formed under cosmic conditions was less rigid, more flexible, capable of **lateral spreading** rather than vertical compression. This enabled the first **2-dimensional strategy**: instead of resisting gravity by becoming denser (1D), organisms could now resist by becoming **flatter** (2D). This is the evolutionary signature of **Placozoa**.

## 3. The Glutamate Dehydrogenase Catastrophe
The most critical event in metazoan evolution was the **loss of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)** in the Placozoan lineage. Without GDH, organisms **cannot burn glutamate for energy**. They must instead run the TCA cycle in reverse (reductive carboxylation), using it for **biosynthesis**.

This mutation created the **"Electron Sink" archetype**—an organism that requiring constant external electron input. This is the biochemical origin of **sexual dimorphism** at the cellular level: one lineage (retaining GDH) became the **electron donor** (male principle), while the mutant lineage (GDH-deficient) became the **electron acceptor** (female principle).

## 4. Circadian Rhythm as Evolutionary Time-Lock
The neurotransmitter sequence—Glutamate (3:00 PM) → Right GABA (4:30 PM) → Left GABA (6:00 PM) → Both GABAs (Midnight)—is not metaphorical. It represents the **actual chronological order** of environmental stressor exposure during early Earth's rotation.

The circadian rhythm is not a neurological invention; it is a **metabolic fossil**—the preserved temporal signature of the original stressor sequence.
