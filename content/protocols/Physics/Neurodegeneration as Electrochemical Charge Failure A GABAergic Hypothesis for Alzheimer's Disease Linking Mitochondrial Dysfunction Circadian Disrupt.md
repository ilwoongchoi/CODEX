Neurodegeneration as Electrochemical Charge Failure: A GABAergic Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease Linking Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Circadian Disruption, and Neuroinflammation

Abstract

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, yet fundamental questions remain regarding what initiates the pathological cascade. This paper proposes an electrochemical framework linking AD to disrupted GABAergic metabolic regulation systems. We hypothesize that deficient GABA pathway function creates simultaneous "cold stress" (dysregulated alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism from KGDHC deficiency) and "darkness stress" (circadian charge dysregulation), generating neuroinflammation and autoimmune-mediated neuronal damage. Central to this hypothesis is alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) deficiency—a well-documented AD feature—representing failed mitochondrial charge management. Neurodegeneration emerges when these regulatory failures trigger chronic microglial activation through loss of noradrenergic anti-inflammatory control. This framework integrates established AD hallmarks—GABAergic interneuron loss, mitochondrial dysfunction, circadian disruption, and neuroinflammation—into a unified mechanistic model with testable predictions regarding biomarkers, genetics, and therapeutic interventions.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 50 million people worldwide, characterized by progressive cognitive decline, neuronal loss, and pathological protein aggregation (1). While amyloid-targeting treatments show limited efficacy, emerging evidence points to GABAergic dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and circadian disruption as early AD features requiring mechanistic integration (2,3).

GABA metabolism intersects energy production through the GABA shunt, consuming alpha-ketoglutarate while generating succinate (4). AD brains show early GABAergic interneuron loss preceding widespread neurodegeneration (5,6), creating excitatory/inhibitory imbalance proposed as a central pathogenic driver (7). Simultaneously, AD features profound reductions in alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) activity—up to 50-75% in severe cases (8,9)—explaining characteristic metabolic hypometabolism yet remaining disconnected from broader pathological understanding.

We propose that AD reflects failure of GABAergic charge regulation systems. Deficient GABA pathway function creates convergent "cold stress" (KGDHC-mediated metabolic dysfunction) and "darkness stress" (circadian dysregulation), triggering neuroinflammation and autoimmune-mediated neuronal damage.

The Hypothesis

Core Propositions

Proposition 1: AD arises from dual GABAergic failures creating KGDHC deficiency (cold stress) and circadian dysregulation (darkness stress), generating permissive conditions for neurodegeneration.

Proposition 2: Alpha-ketoglutarate dysregulation represents critical metabolic dysfunction, with KGDHC deficiency disrupting energy production and epigenetic regulation through alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (10).

Proposition 3: Circadian disruption creates vulnerability windows. Nighttime represents maximum risk when both stresses converge. Circadian fragmentation precedes cognitive symptoms by years (11,12).

Proposition 4: Noradrenergic signaling loss facilitates neuroinflammation. Locus coeruleus degeneration removes anti-inflammatory control, enabling chronic microglial activation (13,14).

Proposition 5: Failed charge regulation redirects stress responses inward, manifesting as autoimmune-like attacks on neuronal structures.

The KGDHC Deficiency Mechanism

KGDHC links TCA cycle flux to energy production while regulating alpha-ketoglutarate levels controlling epigenetic enzymes (15). AD brains show profound KGDHC activity reductions (8,9).

KGDHC deficiency consequences:

Reduced ATP production (metabolic hypometabolism visible on FDG-PET) (16)

Dysregulated alpha-ketoglutarate affecting dioxygenases (TET enzymes, histone demethylases, prolyl hydroxylases)

Impaired mitochondrial calcium buffering leading to excitotoxicity (17)

Oxidative stress from electron transport chain dysfunction

This represents "cold stress"—electrochemical charge management breakdown at the mitochondrial level. Unlike cancer where alpha-ketoglutarate accumulates from deficient GABA shunt consumption, AD shows KGDHC deficiency creating complex dysregulation with both depletion and regional accumulation depending on disease stage.

Recent evidence supports alpha-ketoglutarate's therapeutic potential: calcium alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation ameliorates synaptic plasticity deficits in AD mouse models (18), validating this metabolite's pathological relevance.

GABAergic Interneuron Loss

GABAergic inhibitory interneurons show early and selective AD vulnerability (5,6). Specific populations (parvalbumin-positive, somatostatin-positive) degenerate before widespread neuronal loss, creating excitatory/inhibitory imbalance (7). This hyperexcitability contributes to cognitive symptoms and accelerates neurodegeneration through excitotoxic mechanisms. Epileptic activity occurs at elevated rates in AD patients, reflecting this imbalance (19).

Mechanistic integration: GABAergic interneuron loss removes both synaptic inhibitory control and the GABA shunt's metabolic contribution, connecting circuit-level dysfunction to cellular metabolism. GABA-A receptor changes throughout AD-affected regions suggest active GABAergic system dysfunction rather than passive degeneration (20,21).

Circadian Disruption

Circadian rhythm disruption represents an early AD feature, often preceding cognitive symptoms (11,12). Preclinical AD individuals show fragmented circadian activity patterns compared to amyloid-negative controls (11). Experimental circadian disruption in AD mouse models accelerates amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation (12,22), demonstrating causality.

AD brains show altered circadian clock gene expression (BMAL1, CLOCK, PER, CRY) with disrupted oscillation patterns (23). Combined with reduced melatonin secretion and sleep disruption, this represents fundamental circadian system breakdown.

Darkness stress mechanism: When left GABA pathway deficiency creates circadian charge dysregulation during nighttime, this removes temporal protection against metabolic and inflammatory insults. Convergence with cold stress (KGDHC dysfunction) during nighttime creates maximum vulnerability windows. Circadian rhythms coordinate metabolism, DNA repair, protein degradation, and immune responses—their disruption amplifies all pathological processes (24).

Noradrenergic Signaling and Neuroinflammation

The locus coeruleus (LC)—the brain's primary norepinephrine source—shows among AD's earliest pathological changes, with tau accumulation and neuronal loss preceding cortical involvement by decades (25). LC degeneration reduces noradrenergic tone, removing critical anti-inflammatory influences.

Noradrenergic signaling via β2-adrenergic receptors on microglia inhibits inflammatory responses and promotes surveillance functions (13). LC degeneration removes this brake, enabling chronic microglial activation. AD microglia, especially plaque-associated microglia, significantly downregulate β2-adrenergic receptors, reducing responsiveness to remaining noradrenergic input (13). Experimentally, β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation attenuates amyloid pathology while receptor deletion worsens it (13), demonstrating causal involvement.

Hypothesis integration: Normal GABAergic regulation maintains appropriate noradrenergic signaling patterns. When GABA pathways fail and LC degenerates, loss of noradrenergic anti-inflammatory tone enables chronic microglial activation. This transforms physiological immune surveillance into pathological neuroinflammation driving neurodegeneration.

Critically, this mirrors cancer's mechanism with opposite directionality: cancer involves loss of inhibitory control over proliferative signaling (continuous adrenergic activation driving growth), while AD involves loss of inhibitory control over inflammatory signaling (reduced noradrenergic anti-inflammatory tone enabling chronic inflammation).

The Autoimmune Component

Neuroinflammation drives AD progression, with microglial and astrocytic activation producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (26,27). Classical complement pathway components (C1q, C3) associate with synapses in AD, tagging them for microglial-mediated elimination—essentially autoimmune destruction of neural connections (28). Genetic variants affecting microglial function (particularly TREM2) strongly modify AD risk, emphasizing immune dysfunction's central role (29).

When GABAergic charge regulation fails and stress hormone systems cannot discharge appropriately, stress responses redirect toward self-structures. Microglia become chronically activated, attacking neurons and synapses rather than performing protective surveillance—the neurological equivalent of cancer's dysregulated proliferation, manifesting as dysregulated immune destruction.

Alignment with Established AD Biology

Mitochondrial Dysfunction

The hypothesis emphasizes KGDHC deficiency as central to pathogenesis. Multiple studies document profound KGDHC activity reductions correlating with disease severity (8,9,30). This represents one of AD's most consistent metabolic findings. KGDHC deficiency leads to impaired calcium buffering, contributing to excitotoxicity (17), linking metabolic dysfunction to neuronal vulnerability. FDG-PET imaging shows characteristic glucose metabolism reductions in posterior cingulate and temporoparietal cortices (16), likely substantially reflecting KGDHC deficiency.

GABAergic Dysfunction

Specific interneuron populations show selective early loss in AD models and human brains (5,31). Region-specific and subunit-specific GABA-A receptor alterations correlate with disease severity (20,21,32). Network hyperexcitability from GABAergic dysfunction contributes to cognitive impairment and may accelerate pathology through excitotoxic mechanisms (7,19).

Circadian Disruption

Circadian rhythm fragmentation occurs in preclinical AD years before cognitive symptoms (11), suggesting causal involvement. Chronic circadian disruption in AD mouse models accelerates pathological processes (12,22). Core circadian clock genes show disrupted expression with loss of normal oscillation (23).

Neuroinflammation

AD brains show persistent microglial activation with pro-inflammatory phenotypes contributing to neuronal damage (26,27). LC degeneration and microglial β2-adrenergic receptor downregulation remove anti-inflammatory control (13,14). Complement-mediated synapse elimination represents immune-mediated destruction (28). Multiple AD genetic risk variants affect immune function (TREM2, CD33, APOE) (29).

Testable Predictions

Biomarker Patterns

Prediction 1: Early AD individuals should exhibit reduced KGDHC activity markers, altered plasma alpha-ketoglutarate with circadian phase dependence, reduced CSF GABA/glutamate ratios, elevated inflammatory markers with circadian patterns, and fragmented circadian rhythms detectable via actigraphy.

Prediction 2: Preclinical AD should show GABAergic dysfunction detectable via specialized imaging, circadian biomarker abnormalities preceding cognitive symptoms, noradrenergic deficiency markers, and elevated autoimmune/inflammatory markers.

Genetic Associations

Prediction 3: Polymorphisms in GABA metabolic enzymes (GAD1, GAD2, ABAT), GABA receptors (GABRA/B/G), KGDHC components (OGDH, DLST, DLD), circadian genes (PER1-3, CRY1-2, CLOCK, BMAL1), and adrenergic receptors (ADRA2A, ADRB2) should modify AD risk.

Prediction 4: Gene-gene interactions (GABA pathway × KGDHC × circadian genes, APOE4 × GABAergic dysfunction, TREM2 × noradrenergic signaling genes) should show multiplicative risk effects.

Intervention Studies

Prediction 5: GABAergic modulation during vulnerability windows, metabolic support with alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and circadian rhythm stabilization interventions should slow decline, with effects showing circadian timing dependence and synergistic combination effects.

Prediction 6: Animal models with combined GABAergic interneuron deficits, KGDHC inhibition, and circadian disruption should show dramatically accelerated pathology versus single manipulations, demonstrating mechanistic integration. Intervention timing during subjective night should show enhanced efficacy.

Therapeutic Implications

Prevention and Early Intervention

1. Circadian optimization: Strict sleep-wake schedules, timed light exposure, melatonin supplementation, and avoidance of circadian disruptors in at-risk individuals (33).

2. GABAergic support: Interventions enhancing GABAergic function or restoring excitatory/inhibitory balance during vulnerability windows, potentially including carefully selected GABA-A modulators.

3. Metabolic support: Alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation, particularly calcium alpha-ketoglutarate given preclinical efficacy (18). Mitochondrial support through CoQ10, NAD+ precursors, or related approaches.

4. Anti-inflammatory approaches: β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation or locus coeruleus-protective interventions maintaining anti-inflammatory noradrenergic tone.

Treatment Enhancement

1. Chronotherapy: Timing interventions to circadian phases for optimal efficacy—drug delivery, cognitive training, physical activity aligned with circadian biology (34).

2. Combination approaches: Integrated strategies addressing GABAergic dysfunction, metabolic support, circadian stabilization, and anti-inflammatory modulation simultaneously.

3. Personalized timing: Individual chronotype assessment and genetic profiling to optimize intervention timing.

Limitations

1. Mechanistic complexity: The hypothesis operates at systems level without fully specifying all molecular mechanisms linking GABAergic dysfunction to specific AD pathological features.

2. Causality questions: Does GABAergic/KGDHC dysfunction cause AD, or does AD cause these changes? Likely bidirectional relationships exist, requiring careful temporal studies.

3. Phenotype heterogeneity: AD shows substantial clinical and pathological heterogeneity. The hypothesis may apply more strongly to certain subtypes.

Conclusions

We propose that Alzheimer's disease reflects failure of GABAergic charge regulation systems managing alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism and circadian charge balance. Vulnerable phenotypes experience simultaneous cold stress (KGDHC deficiency with dysregulated alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism) and darkness stress (circadian dysregulation), creating neuroinflammation and autoimmune-mediated neuronal damage.

Central to this framework is KGDHC deficiency—representing failed mitochondrial charge management. GABAergic interneuron loss creates both synaptic dysfunction (excitatory/inhibitory imbalance) and metabolic stress (reduced GABA shunt activity). Locus coeruleus degeneration removes noradrenergic anti-inflammatory tone, enabling chronic microglial activation attacking neurons and synapses.

This hypothesis integrates established AD biology—GABAergic dysfunction, mitochondrial failure, circadian disruption, and neuroinflammation—into a unified electrochemical framework generating testable predictions regarding biomarkers, genetics, and therapeutic interventions targeting GABAergic restoration, metabolic support, circadian optimization, and anti-inflammatory approaches.

If validated, this framework enables risk stratification, preventive strategies for high-risk individuals, chronotherapeutic interventions, and integrated treatment approaches addressing fundamental electrochemical dysregulation rather than downstream consequences alone.
