Conflict of Interest Statement

The author declares no conflicts of interest. This manuscript represents original research with no prior publication, and is not under consideration elsewhere. The author has no financial, professional, or personal interests that could bias the presentation or interpretation of the research.



Data Availability Statement

The theoretical framework, dimensional biophysics model, and all seven falsifiable predictions are presented in full within the manuscript. No primary data sets, code repositories, or supplementary datasets are available at this time, as this submission represents a novel theoretical framework for future empirical testing. Supplementary datasets, including detailed protocols and predicted metabolomic signatures, are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
