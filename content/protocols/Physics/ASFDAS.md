Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit my review article entitled "Migraine as a Thermodynamic Survival Mechanism" for consideration in The Journal of Headache and Pain.

This manuscript proposes a novel bioenergetic framework for migraine, integrating mitochondrial dysfunction, cortical spreading depression, and the trigeminal vascular response into a unified homeostatic reset mechanism. Given the journal's focus on translational and mechanistic headache research, I believe this theoretical perspective will be of significant interest to your readership.

I declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published before, and is not currently being considered for publication elsewhere.

Sincerely,
Il Woong Choi
