# Dear Editor

Dear Editor,

I am submitting my manuscript, "Suicide as a Thermodynamic Failure of the 'Metabolic Sink'," for consideration as a Regular Paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.

This paper proposes a novel biophysical framework for suicide, integrating thermodynamics, membrane biophysics (Na+/K+-ATPase failure), and social field theory (the Werther Effect). Unlike traditional psychological models, this work provides a mechanistic explanation for the physiological comorbidities observed in suicide clusters.

Given the Journal of Theoretical Biology’s history of publishing rigorous theoretical models that challenge existing paradigms, I believe this manuscript is an excellent fit for your readership.

I declare no conflicts of interest.

Sincerely,
Il Woong Choi
