Title

Engineering the Defect Landscape: Static Electrostatic Control of TLS Noise in Superconducting Qubits



1. Introduction

Superconducting qubits are widely viewed as a leading platform for quantum information processing, but their performance is still limited by decoherence arising from microscopic defects in dielectrics and interfaces. These defects are commonly modeled as ensembles of two-level systems (TLS), each described as a localized quantum system with an electric dipole moment that couples to the qubit’s electric field. In many state-of-the-art transmon and related architectures, careful separation of loss channels has shown that once quasiparticles and radiation are suppressed, dielectric loss associated with these TLS dominates the energy-relaxation time .

Systematic “participation-ratio” analyses have demonstrated that a small fraction of the device volume—thin amorphous interfacial layers at metal–substrate and metal–vacuum boundaries—contributes a disproportionate share of the electric-field energy and therefore of the TLS-induced loss. Improvements in materials (e.g. crystalline substrates, reduced native oxides, optimized metallization) and geometric design (e.g. increasing capacitor gaps, rounding edges) have reduced surface participation and extended coherence times, but TLS-related loss and noise remain a central bottleneck for scaling to larger processors.

In parallel, a second line of work has shown that individual, strongly coupled TLS are not immutable scatterers: electric-field control and microwave dressing can Stark-shift their energies and modify their coupling to qubit modes. Experiments that apply DC or low-frequency electric fields to junction and capacitor regions have demonstrated frequency tuning of specific TLS and associated changes in qubit frequency and coherence, while spectroscopy techniques have mapped out the dynamics and interactions of TLS ensembles. These results indicate that, in addition to reducing the density and participation of defects, it is possible to actively engineer their effective spectrum and coupling via controlled local electric fields.



2. Concept: Static Electrostatic Engineering of TLS

The central idea of this work is to treat the near-surface electrostatic potential and static electric-field profile as a first-class design parameter for superconducting qubits. Instead of only attempting to lower TLS density or move electric-field energy away from defective regions, the proposal is to deliberately introduce static electric fields in high-participation regions in order to reshape the defect landscape at the microscopic level.

At the scale of an individual TLS, the relevant microscopic object is a localized two-level defect with an electric dipole moment , embedded in a disordered dielectric or interfacial layer. In the presence of a static electric field , the TLS energy splitting acquires a Stark shift , while the effective coupling to the qubit mode depends on the alignment and magnitude of both the qubit field and . For slow, charge-like fluctuators and interacting defects, a nonuniform static field also defines a potential landscape with minima and barriers that can localize or immobilize such defects, suppressing their contribution to low-frequency noise.

This work proposes to realize such controlled static fields by integrating an ionic-dielectric layer into the device stack, positioned in regions where finite-element modeling and participation-ratio calculations show large electric-field concentrations in conventional designs (for example, at transmon capacitor edges and thin interfacial layers). At millikelvin temperatures and under suitable material choices, the ionic-dielectric layer provides predominantly static or quasi-static electric fields, with negligible ion motion on qubit timescales, thus acting as a designed electrostatic environment for the TLS ensemble. The goal is to Stark-shift strongly coupled TLS away from the qubit transition, pin slow fluctuators into deep potential wells, and route residual electric-field energy into regions or modes with low defect participation, while incurring only a controlled additional dielectric loss from the new layer.



3. Scope and Contributions of the Paper

Within the standard weak-coupling, Markovian treatment of qubit–environment interactions, TLS-induced relaxation and dephasing rates can be expressed in terms of spectral densities determined by the distribution of TLS energies, dipole moments, and couplings to the qubit field. This paper develops a combined analytic-numerical framework in which:

The qubit is modeled as an effective two-level system coupled to an ensemble of dipolar TLS defects located in specific dielectric regions, with parameters informed by existing TLS and surface-loss studies.

A static electric-field profile, generated by an engineered ionic-dielectric layer and the device geometry, is computed using finite-element simulations of the multilayer stack, and enters the TLS Hamiltonian via Stark shifts and modified couplings.

The resulting modified TLS spectral density is used to derive changes in qubit energy-relaxation and dephasing rates, as well as in frequency noise statistics, allowing quantitative evaluation of potential coherence gains versus added loss from the ionic material.

Based on this framework, the paper aims to: (i) identify parameter regimes—ionic-layer thickness, permittivity, charge density, and placement—that can significantly reduce effective TLS-induced decoherence for realistic material stacks; (ii) articulate design rules that complement existing participation-reduction strategies; and (iii) outline a staged experimental program, from single-qubit devices to small multi-qubit arrays, to test and refine the defect-landscape engineering approach using established TLS spectroscopy and coherence-benchmarking techniques.

4. Microscopic Model and Hamiltonian

4.1 Qubit–TLS Hamiltonian

The starting point is the conventional model of a superconducting qubit coupled to an ensemble of electric-dipole TLS located in its dielectric environment. Each TLS is described as a localized two-level system with energy splitting and electric dipole moment , embedded at position in an amorphous or interfacial region. The bare Hamiltonian is written as the sum of the qubit term , the TLS ensemble , the interaction , and a broad environmental bath that includes phonons and other electromagnetic modes.

The qubit is treated in its lowest two levels as an effective two-level system with transition frequency . The TLS ensemble is modeled as a collection of independent two-level systems with parameters drawn from a distribution consistent with dielectric-loss and spectroscopy data, for example a broad distribution of asymmetry energies and tunneling amplitudes. The interaction between the qubit and each TLS arises from the coupling of the TLS dipole to the qubit’s electric field , leading to a transverse or longitudinal coupling term depending on the relative orientation and microscopic structure. This framework has been extensively used to explain dielectric loss in resonators and qubits and to analyze TLS-limited and noise spectra.

4.2 Static electrostatic term from engineered fields

The proposed modification is the introduction of a static electrostatic field term that reflects the presence of an engineered ionic-dielectric layer in the device stack. At millikelvin temperatures and under appropriate material choices, such a layer contributes a predominantly static local electric field in regions where the qubit electric field is large, such as capacitor edges and thin interfacial layers identified by participation-ratio calculations. This static field acts on each TLS dipole, adding a Stark shift term to its Hamiltonian and modifying both its energy splitting and effective coupling to the qubit mode.

In practice, the spatial profile is obtained from finite-element simulations of the full multilayer stack, using the chosen ionic-dielectric thickness, permittivity, and charge distribution, together with the qubit geometry. For each TLS position , the Stark shift is proportional to , leading to a modified energy splitting . Slow charge-like fluctuators and interacting defects also experience the resulting potential landscape, which can contain local minima that trap mobile defects and convert fast fluctuations into quasi-static offsets; this mechanism has been invoked to explain stochastic jumps and -like noise in qubit frequency and relaxation times.

4.3 Effective spectral densities and decoherence rates

In the weak-coupling, Markovian regime, the impact of the TLS ensemble on qubit dynamics can be expressed in terms of effective spectral densities that encode the distribution of defect energies and couplings. Introducing the static field modifies the TLS energies and, in general, their coupling matrix elements, thereby reshaping the spectral density seen by the qubit without changing the underlying microscopic model. The effective relaxation rate and pure dephasing rate are then recomputed using standard Fermi’s-Golden-Rule expressions and noise-spectral arguments, with the new spectral density that includes Stark-shifted TLS levels and potentially immobilized fluctuators.

This microscopic treatment provides a quantitative bridge from device-level design choices—ionic-dielectric thickness, permittivity, charge density, and spatial placement—through finite-element electric-field calculations, to predicted changes in TLS spectral density and qubit decoherence rates. It thereby enables systematic exploration of design regimes in which static electrostatic engineering can significantly reduce TLS-induced loss and noise, while the additional participation and intrinsic loss of the new dielectric layer remain within acceptable bounds. 

5. Finite-Element Modeling and Design Rules

5.1 Device-level field and participation calculations

To evaluate and optimize static electrostatic control, the first step is to compute the spatial distribution of both the qubit’s AC field and the engineered DC field within a realistic multilayer stack. Participation-ratio studies for transmons already use finite-element (FE) simulations to determine where electric-field energy is concentrated and which interfaces dominate dielectric loss. The same workflow can be extended by adding the ionic-dielectric layer, with specified thickness, permittivity, and charge density, to obtain:

The qubit mode electric field and participation factors of all dielectrics.

The static field generated by the ionic-dielectric layer, electrodes, and boundary conditions.

Combining these simulations identifies “hot zones” where both and are large, and therefore where dipolar TLS experience the strongest Stark shifts and where added participation must be tightly controlled.

5.2 Mapping design parameters to TLS spectrum

Given a statistical model for TLS positions, dipole orientations, and density in each dielectric region, the FE fields allow direct computation of Stark shifts and modified couplings for each defect realization. For a chosen set of design parameters—ionic-layer thickness, permittivity, and charge distribution—the procedure is:

Sample TLS positions and dipole moments in high-participation regions consistent with measured loss tangents and spectroscopy data.

Use to compute Stark-shifted energies for each TLS and thus the new energy distribution.

Recalculate the effective spectral density seen by the qubit at and its vicinity, and derive modified , dephasing rates, and frequency-noise statistics via the weak-coupling formulas.

By scanning over design parameters, one can generate contour plots of predicted coherence metrics versus ionic-layer properties and placement. These plots directly expose regions where TLS spectral weight is pushed away from the qubit transition while the additional participation of the ionic dielectric remains small compared with existing interfaces.

5.3 Design rules and trade-offs

From this combined FE–TLS analysis, several design rules emerge:

Placement: confine the ionic-dielectric layer to regions where FE simulations show high surface participation in the bare design, such as capacitor edges and specific metal–substrate interfaces, avoiding areas where it would add loss without providing significant Stark control.

Thickness and permittivity: choose thickness and dielectric constant to generate sufficient static field for meaningful Stark shifts (comparable to or larger than typical TLS linewidths) while keeping the fractional participation of the new layer below a target threshold set by its intrinsic loss tangent.

Charge density and stability: select ionic materials and processing conditions that yield static or quasi-static charge configurations at millikelvin temperatures, minimizing slow drift that would appear as low-frequency noise; design should be benchmarked against known TLS and charge-noise behaviors.

These rules formalize the trade-off between defect-spectrum reshaping and added dielectric loss, and provide concrete targets for materials and geometry optimization in subsequent experimental work.



6. Experimental Roadmap

6.1 Single-qubit and resonator prototypes

The initial phase focuses on simple test structures where TLS behavior is well-characterized:

Fabricate matched sets of resonators and transmon-like qubits with and without the ionic-dielectric layer in selected regions, keeping all other processing identical.

Measure internal quality factors, , , and frequency noise over time at millikelvin temperatures, comparing distributions across devices and wafers to quantify changes in average loss and device-to-device variability.

In parallel, perform TLS-focused experiments:

Use swap spectroscopy, spectral hole burning, and electric-field tuning to directly observe shifts in individual TLS frequencies and couplings in devices with the engineered static field, leveraging established TLS spectroscopy techniques.

Analyze whether the density of strongly coupled TLS near the qubit frequency is reduced and whether characteristic stochastic jumps attributed to interacting defects are suppressed or altered.

6.2 Scaling to small multi-qubit arrays

Once single-device gains and trade-offs are characterized, the approach can be extended to small processor-like chips:

Implement the optimized ionic-dielectric design in arrays of fixed-frequency qubits and couplers, guided by surface-participation and loss-budget analyses.

Compare calibration overhead, frequency collision statistics, drift of qubit parameters, and logical-gate fidelities to control chips without engineered static fields.

These experiments connect microscopic defect-engineering to system-level performance, testing whether the predicted improvements in coherence and stability translate into reduced variability and more reliable operation in realistic architectures.

6.3 Feedback to modeling and materials

Finally, discrepancies between modeled and measured behavior—such as unexpected added loss, residual low-frequency noise, or incomplete TLS detuning—provide direct feedback to refine both the TLS ensemble assumptions and the material choice for the ionic-dielectric layer. Iterating between FE modeling, TLS characterization, and device fabrication follows the same loop that has driven progress in surface-loss mitigation and materials optimization for superconducting qubits, but with static electrostatic control as an additional, tunable degree of freedom.
