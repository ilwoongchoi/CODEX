The Leaky Capacitor: Atopic Dermatitis as a Peripheral Sensory Seizure
Subtitle: Loss of epidermal dielectric integrity unmasks the intrinsic firing rate of C-fiber pruriceptors, driving a "Kindling" model of itch.

Abstract
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is characterized by intense pruritus that often disproportionately exceeds the visible cutaneous inflammation. We propose the "Leaky Capacitor" hypothesis to explain this dissociation. We posit that the healthy epidermis functions not merely as a physical barrier, but as an electrical dielectric that insulates the high-voltage network of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENFs). In AD, the degradation of the filaggrin-lipid matrix effectively lowers the capacitive resistance of the skin, "short-circuiting" the sensory apparatus. This loss of impedance reduces the activation threshold of unmyelinated C-fibers, leading to a state of "Peripheral Sensitization" analogous to a focal seizure. I argue that the immune response is largely secondary—a neurogenic reaction to the antidromic release of neuropeptides from these continuously firing nerves. Restoring the dielectric integrity of the stratum corneum, rather than solely targeting cytokines, is critical for preventing the progression from peripheral itch to central pain.

In a Nutshell

The Paradox: The intensity of itch in AD often precedes and exceeds the severity of the dermatitis ("The Itch that Rashes").

The Model: I propose a "Capacitor Model" where the stratum corneum functions as the electrical dielectric for sensory nerves.

The Lesion: Disruption of the lipid barrier lowers the Impedance, allowing environmental noise to trigger high-threshold C-fibers.

The Consequence: Neurogenic inflammation is a downstream consequence of this electrical failure, driving a "Kindling" effect in the dorsal horn.

Introduction: The Itch That Rashes
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, yet its primary etiology remains a subject of intense debate. The dominant "Inside-Out" theory posits that an inherent immune dysregulation (Th2 polarization) drives barrier breakdown, while the "Outside-In" theory argues that barrier defects (e.g., filaggrin mutations) allow allergen penetration and subsequent inflammation. However, both models often struggle to explain the clinical reality of the "Itch that Rashes"—the observation that intense, paroxysmal pruritus frequently precedes visible dermatitis and persists even after inflammation is suppressed .

I propose a third, biophysical perspective: AD represents a "Dielectric Collapse." I argue that the epidermis serves a critical, non-canonical role: it is the electrical insulator for the dense network of Intra-Epidermal Nerve Fibers (IENFs) that sense the environment. When this insulation fails, the skin becomes a "Leaky Capacitor," and the sensory system enters a state of hyperexcitability analogous to epilepsy. This hypothesis re-evaluates the pathophysiology of AD, suggesting that the primary failure is not just the entry of material allergens, but the loss of the electrical resistance that keeps the sensory nerves silent.

The Epidermis as a Dielectric
To understand the failure, we must model the skin as a circuit. The stratum corneum is a lipid-rich matrix composed of ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. In biophysical terms, lipids are dielectrics—materials that resist the flow of electric current. The unmyelinated C-fibers that sense itch (pruriceptors) penetrate deep into this matrix, terminating just micrometers from the surface .

In healthy skin, the high electrical impedance of the lipid barrier (often exceeding 100 kΩ/cm²) prevents these naked nerve endings from depolarizing in response to low-voltage environmental static (pH changes, microbiome ionic shifts, temperature flux) . This "Resistive Barrier" acts as a high-pass filter, maintaining a high rheobase (firing threshold) for the nerve. It ensures that only significant noxious stimuli (mechanical trauma, chemical burns) can generate enough current to trigger an action potential. Essentially, the healthy skin acts as a Faraday cage for its own nerves.

The Short Circuit: Loss of Impedance
In AD, the structural integrity of this dielectric is compromised. The loss-of-function mutations in FLG (filaggrin) and the reduction in ceramide synthesis are well-documented . Structurally, this leads to Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL). But electrically, this represents a catastrophic loss of impedance. Water is a conductor. As the skin hydrates from the outside (sweat, humidity) without the hydrophobic lipid shield to repel it, the dielectric constant of the epidermis drops precipitously .

This creates a "Short Circuit." The "stripped wires" of the IENFs are now exposed to the ionic flux of the external environment. Stimuli that should be sub-threshold—such as the salt in sweat, the friction of wool, or even emotional stress-induced vasodilation—now generate enough transmembrane current to trigger a full depolarization . This is Peripheral Sensitization. The nerve is not responding to a specific allergen; it is responding to the loss of resistance. The patient is literally "feeling" the electrical noise of the environment because their insulation is gone.

Neurogenic Inflammation: The Antidromic Surge
The consequence of this unbuffered firing is not limited to sensation. Once the C-fiber fires, it generates an orthodromic signal to the brain (perceived as Itch). However, it simultaneously generates an antidromic (backward) signal via the Axon Reflex .

This antidromic depolarization triggers the release of potent neuropeptides—specifically Substance P (SP) and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)—from the nerve terminals directly into the dermis . These neuropeptides are master regulators of inflammation. Substance P binds to the MRGPRX2 receptor on mast cells, causing immediate degranulation independent of IgE . CGRP drives potent vasodilation (the "flare" response).

Crucially, these neuropeptides recruit and activate Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils, driving the expression of IL-4 and IL-13 . Thus, the "immune" inflammation seen in AD is often Neurogenic in origin. The immune system is arriving to put out the fire started by the short-circuited nerve. Treating the inflammation with steroids or biologics without fixing the dielectric failure is akin to fighting the smoke while the wire is still sparking. This explains the high rate of recurrence upon cessation of immunosuppressive therapy.

The "Kindling" Phenomenon
The long-term consequence of this "Leaky Capacitor" is the remodeling of the central nervous system. The chronic, high-frequency barrage of afferent signals from the skin induces synaptic plasticity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . This phenomenon, known as "Kindling" (borrowed from epilepsy literature), involves the strengthening of synaptic connections and the loss of descending inhibition.

Over time, second-order neurons in the spinal cord become spontaneously active, even in the absence of peripheral input. This leads to Central Sensitization (Alloknesis), where light touch is perceived as itch . The pathology has migrated from the peripheral capacitor to the central processor. This "imprinting" of the itch circuit explains why chronic AD patients often report "phantom itch" or severe pruritus in non-lesional skin . It suggests that AD can progress from a dermatological condition to a neurological disorder if the capacitive failure is not addressed early.

Conclusions and Prospects
Reframing AD as a "Sensory Seizure" driven by dielectric failure shifts the therapeutic paradigm from purely anti-inflammatory to Re-Insulating strategies.

Restoring the Dielectric: Moisturizers are often viewed as cosmetic adjuncts, but in this model, they are "liquid insulation." Lipid-heavy emollients (specifically those with physiological ratios of ceramides) restore the dielectric constant of the stratum corneum, artificially raising the firing threshold of the C-fibers . Clinical studies showing that prophylactic emollient use in neonates can prevent AD onset support this "insulation" hypothesis .

Dampening the Voltage: If the insulation cannot be fully restored, we must stabilize the wire. The use of voltage-gated channel blockers—such as gabapentinoids (calcium channel blockers) or topical sodium channel blockers—could stabilize the nerve membrane directly . This treats the itch as a form of focal epilepsy rather than an allergy.

Stopping the Kindling: Aggressive early intervention is required to prevent the "imprinting" of the itch circuit. Just as early seizure control is critical in epilepsy, early "Itch Control" (regardless of the inflammatory status) may be necessary to prevent the transition to centralized neuropathic itch .

By viewing the skin as a capacitor and the itch as a short circuit, we integrate the barrier, neural, and immune defects of AD into a single, coherent biophysical model.
