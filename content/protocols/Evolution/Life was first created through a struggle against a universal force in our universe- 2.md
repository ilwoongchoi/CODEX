# Life was first created through a struggle against a universal force in our universe- 2

Life was first created through a struggle against a universal force in our universe, gravity. Lightening struck the water on the Earth, and the first amino acids were formed. In laws of entropy, heat creates dispersion and irregularity and low heat causes order and regularity. However, because the lightening, which is heat, struck against the force of gravity which pulled everything apart towards the planet’s core, the heat worked in a way that produced order. It produced collection of matter and order against the disintegration that gravity exerted. These amino acids were no life yet, but they could overcome gravity and stay afloat on top of water thanks to the buoyant force of water. The first amino acids were likely created in the day because lightening struck more often during the day than night, and also another factor that could create amino acid was uv light. 



Then came the first night. Amino acids, products of heat, were vulnerable to cold. They faced disintegration when the sun disappeared due to cold temperature. The first amino acid, glutamate, a faint drop of chemical compound that floated on top of water on the ocean of the Earth, devised a way to fight this hazard of disintegration, and created another amino acid, gaba, to endure cold stress and stop itself from disintegrating. Gaba, a negative force that protected against the cold, helped glutamate endure the long night until the Sun appeared again. With this new molecule gaba, time was created. Gaba helped delay stress and perishment, which would prevent its instant disintegration in cold and helped it endure stress until sun came out. However, the problem with gaba was that if the gaba kept on working on glutamate, its negative force will make glutamate smaller and smaller, until it perished to nothingness. So even if a new day came, they would all still perish because the gaba would make them smaller, while new glutamates would be formed by the sun light and lightening. when a new day came, gaba, although it helped glutamate survive till the sun came out, was pretty pointless because the sun will make new glutamates during the day, and the glutamate that struggled to survive overnight will vanish into thin air. So the glutamate vanished into thin air the next day when the day came, and new glutamates were formed. Night came again, and new glutamates too faced dinstegration from cold. Gabas were formed by the new glutamates, and they endured but it was pretty in vein because they were all going to perish the next day as they feel the relief of warmth from the sunlight the next day. However morning was approaching and the glutamate was getting ever more smaller, the gaba that was stuck to glutamate came up with an idea. but at the same time continuously diminishing itself towards an inevitable disappearance into a tiny spot, found an idea. It added another gaba to the gaba that was already there, and made a plus gaba. The original gaba that helped glutamate endure cold had the value of -, but as another gaba was added, it formed a plus force. A positive force. Now this was of no ordinary invention, because you might think well a negative added to a negative obviously makes +, so whats so new about it? But a negative plus negative does not make plus, it makes zero. It brings point back to the start point. As the first glutamates were enduring cold stress, gabas were helping them but at the same time making them smaller, so if another force hadn’t intervened it would keep on going that way, smaller. However, by adding another gaba to itself, the glutamate turned the direction of change from getting smaller to bigger and brought itself back to its original size, but also started a new endeavour of growing bigger from its original size. Or it can be put in a way that the second gaba not only stopped the getting smaller which was caused by the first one, but started a new growth. So this gaba, by adding another same 1 gaba, has achieved the benefit of 2. It could start growing bigger. This was the start growth and a start of life. But not only life, it was the start of space and time. Until then, there were only 1 dimension. Top and bottom, You and Me, Glutamate and Gaba, two points and the distance between eachother. However, by exerting the same force again but making two strides, a new dimension had been formed in between the two points on the dimension. Life now could grow out from merely a point, so it could grow in 1 dimension, but for space, there advented a new dimension that was parallel to the original 1 dimension and also time started to flow. Until then, the 1 negative gaba merely retained amino acids to an inevitable death by endless diminishment or just a point floating on top of water waiting to get disintegrated by cold at night. However, just as the sunrise was approaching in a knack of a second, a new second gaba was added that not only lengthed the life of glutamate until sunrise, but also enabled it to reproduce and bigger so that it can live through the next day and the next nights(glutamate1). From then on, as each moment passed after the addition of second gaba, a new dimension has been formed, because from then, an addition(+) of gaba(-) initself includes another dimension. Every moment a time passes, to the perpendicular direction of the endurance of the previously made glutamate1 and passage of time, a newly added gaba not only exerts force on the negative direction of the original but starts a new growth , or adds a new dimension. but it creates new direction of growth perpendicular to the original dimension. Because we need to grow. Ever since then, every moment a new glutamate was formed, then as a gaba started exerting its force on the glutamate the next moment, its endurance began but also a new dimension formed where nother glutamate will be formed.

















And ever since then life was dependent and subordinate to passage of time, an inevitable run towards death. 



As amino acids such as glutamate turned into life with the help of gaba and started growing in size, they became vulnerable to gravity again and some of them started sinking towards the sea floor. The ones still at the top of the water surface was getting hit by hard uv radiation which was getting stronger day by day as the sun was getting hotter with growth. At the bottom of the sea floor where the heavier ones fell to, was hydrothermal vents, which outletted hot gas and water. This caused them heat stress and also the sunlight as well(explain the relationship between lateral growth and sunlight). The new organisms needed a way to endure heat stress and run away from them, and thus acetylcholine was produced by putting together gaba with glutamate(1). This acetylcholine, which helped microorganisms deal with heat stress, also gave them motor force to move away from heat or any hazard while coping with redox stress which was caused by glutamate, the energy. Acetylcholine was produced by gaba to endure redox stress caused by glutamate(1), which was created by itself. Redox stress is a stress that is created when energy affluent molecules such as biomolecules like glutamate and inorganic natural molecules such as sulphur and phosphate loses electron which is their energy, and tries to regain this electron from something else, in this case the microorganisms. The micro organisms needed a way to hold onto their electrons, and they came up with an idea to use the molecules that are causing redox stress itself, in this case sulphur and phosphorus etc, to get hold of electrons that they are losing use it to make energy and then give it back to the inorganic molecule to prevent it from using themselves as electron donors which causes them redox stress. This was how the most primal microorganisms retained life and simultaneously balanced between redox stress and energy needs. However, as acetylcholine allowed them mobility away from the sunlight and other heat sources and stay at the bottom of the ocean, they could access the load of organic molecules that are falling to the bottom of the ocean from the dead debris of life. Primal microorganisms altered their way of life from using environment to get rid of their stress, to using other life forms as electron doners and acceptors, to both get and dispose of electrons, relieving both energy and redox stress. From then on life started spending and consuming energy that was created through glutamate that they engulfed from the outside to move around, and stay buoyant away from heat sources such as sunlight and hydrothermal vent from the bottom of the water, with their own acetylcholine, which also allowed the engulfing and digesting of the organic molecules and dispose of them. (This not only gave them motor force but also ability to engulf other organisms and take energy from them, in redox terms obtaining electron donors to get rid of their electrons to be free of redox stress.). Life started using other lives to sustain their own life. With this new mode of life, sexes in life has appeared to cope with diverse stresses in life such as temperature change and redox change. In bacteria, cells would primarily be of neutral sex, but when they became vulnerable to a certain type of stress, it would turn momentarily into that sex to cope with it, while retaining with other individuals that have also turned into according sexes by a means of communication called quorum sensing. Female sexes were those resistant to cold stress(adapted to cold), males were more resistant to energy stress(adapted to heat).



Whilst, at the top of the ocean still while the benthic organisms were developing ways of sustaining life by using other life, another form of life appeared. Cyanobacteria , which uses a new chemical molecule serotonin, which is made by adding glutamate and acetylcholine(glutamate + gaba), appeared and started using sunlight as energy source. Cyanobacteria had stayed at the top of the ocean unlike benthic organisms that fell to the bottom and had to resort to using acetylcholine, and had retained their nature using way of life. It honed the energy given by the sunlight with the usage of serotonin that helped it detect sunlight, and carried out photosynthesis which used water as the electron donor for energy generation and carbon dioxide to dispose of electrons, and I  the process making oxygen as a byproduct. (to grow into a new dimension, previously created by Gaba. Photosynthesis uses sunlight instead of inorganic molecules to get electrons from to make energy, and in the process makes a surplus 1 extra electron. It also makes another chemical called melatonin, which was gotten this time by adding serotonin and acetylcholine, when the day is coming to a close and night approaches to stop photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis had also created a new problem, oxygen stress, a new redox stress caused by the byproduct on life by taking away electrons again. This self-detrimentality of the process was caused by the same self-detrimentality as seen in the first redox stress. As a result of advent of cyanobacteria and photosynthesis, the Earth atmosphere gradually increased in oxygen content. This oxygen not only caused self-detriment to cyanobacteria, but also to other organisms as well. The subsurface waters of the ocean were increased in oxygen concentration as well, and the anaerobic microorganisms that were living there sustaining their chemolithotrophic or phagocytic way of living, were affected by this new type of redox stress, oxidation stress. This gave rise to the first aerobic respirating organisms, oxidative phosphorylating bacteria, which started using the oxygen from the environment to produce energy. With this new mechanism, they adapted to the new environment with the oxygenated atmosphere of the Earth using hazardous redox causing oxygen to produce energy. Photosynthesis had omitted the need for diversion into sexes in cyanobacteria, but also in the process made a self-detrimental problem of oxidation stress.



As the oxygenation of the Earth intensified, there formed a interface zone under the top surface of the water where it functioned as a buffer zone between oxygenated and anoxic zones. Here at first no organisms inhabited, but gradually the anaerobic organisms from the deep sea and surface organisms which coped with oxygenated environment met here, and there rose a need to adapt to this new environment. During the day, there is clear distinction between the oxygen concentration in the very surface of the ocean and the bottom half of the depth of the ocean because there is photosynthesis. However, at night the temperature of the water goes down, mixing well the topmost layer with the subsurface layer, dispersing oxygen into lower parts. With the cease of photosynthesis, the surface becomes decreased with oxygen in turn, and the subsurface layer nearer to the middle becomes more saturated with oxygen. So the oxido – phosphorylating primitive respirator would descend from the top most part to the subsurface lower, to escape hypoxia. While, the anaerobic bacteria living in the deeper part of the ocean which uses acetylcholine to keep on running away from heat stress at day time, would rise into the middle part because it would be lesser hotter here than lower part where the hydrothermal venting would persist. So here at night, the two organisms living in distinct environments meet, and one of the anaerobic bacteria happened to engulf an oxido-phosphorylating microorganism, which gave the anaerobic bacteria a mechanism to breathe oxygen and survive in oxygenic environment. This is the birth of the first Eukaryotic organism, ancestor to all animals and plants. Now, life could balance between heat stress and oxygen stress.



Eukaryotic organisms started producing a chemical called melatonin, which was produced by putting together serotonin and acetylcholine, to mark the end of the day and start of the night. Melatonin levels start rising shortly before sunset, and it is maintained at a high level throughout the night. With the signage of melatonin, eukaryotic beings would descend down to the depth of the water to find quarters with more oxygen, and as the melatonin levels decreased when the dawn came, they rose back up to the surface to find oxygen. Melatonin enabled vertical oscillating movement in eukaryotes. However, more importantly it marks the time of arrival for the acetylcholine using organisms, that depend on other life to sustain their own life, and eukaryotes have developed a way to keep a watch on them. All eukaryotic organisms produce melatonin. With the advent of melatonin and adaptation of oxygen, the usage of acetylcholine would be reversed. Unti then acetylcholine was used to escape heat stress, preferably to move away from the two ends of the depth of the ocean. However from now one, acetylcholine would be used to approach the two ends, prefererably the top surface, in combination with serotonin during day time to shoot for the Sun. Now the usage of the Acetylcholine and Serotonin aligned in time and direction.



After the beginning of eukaryotic life, life proliferated in volume. It became multicellular and different cells started taking up different roles. However, before becoming multicellular, even the single cells expanded in volume, and they became motile using their acetylcholine and optionally serotonin for detecting light or movement of the prey. Two distinct groups of eukaryotes emerged: Choanoflagellates, single celled organisms which used acetylcholine for movement and dopamine for reward when they reached the food; and Cnidarians, jellyfish-like multicellular beings which used dopamine coupled with inhibitory serotonin at night time to ascend from the deeper part of the water into the higher part to prey on planktons, while at daytime used serotonin inherited from their ancestors to detect sunlight and safely descend into the deeper darker part of the ocean for safety. Actually, cnidarians are descendants of choanoflagellates, and choanoflagellates used dopamine during the daytime to get motivation for predation on tiny bacteria. Dopamine is a reward chemical that causes pleasure in humans, and in primal life it provided an instant reward for an action, in this case moving towards a food source and is secreted as it engulfs the prey organism. It is like glutamate in a sense that it provides energy and motivation, because glutamate provided motivation for gaba to lengthen life and endure stress and dopamine helps life endure the time and the swim it takes to get to the prey. First muscle movement was introduce to life by sequentially using gaba, acetylcholine, gaba , acetylcholine to contract the muscle and then inhibit contraction to move forward, and when the objective or the prey is reached it gets dopamine as a reward. With the creation of dopamine, the initial discrepancy between the direction of a living organisms fear(Heat from Sun), and its actual mode of behaviour(to run towards it) that gaba created, was closed, and now an organism would act on its instinct immediately when it detects prey(serotonin) for survival and get a reward. The timing of serotonin and dopamine was instant and aligned. Cnidarians, a multicellular eukaryote that has evolved from choanoflagellate, was the first organism to produce Inhibitory Serotonin-like chemical and inhibitory serotonin is gotten by adding gaba to serotonin, simply exerting a negative force to inhibit serotonin. With this inhibitory serotonin, cnidarians has brought distinction to their behaviour during day and night, in a reversed way to its ancestors. In the first Eukaryotes, serotonin was used to detect sunlight or prey and acetylcholine was used with dopamine to provide the means and reward for an instant behaviour as it detects the prey. However, inhibitory serotonin brought distinction between day and night, and at night it would rise up to the surface of the ocean to prey on planktons using dopamine and acetylcholine, while in the day using serotonin to let go of muscle movement that was sustained by acetylcholine and dopamine and falling to lower levels succumbing to gravity. Cnidarians, inheriting traits from their anaerobic ancestor that engulfed oxido-phorylating organism, is well adapted to cold stress, and as the climate was getting even more oxygenated and also warmer when cnidarians appeared, they adjusted to sexual reproduction to adapt to both changes. Cnidarians also have two distinct phases in life: Planula phase and medusa phase. Planula phase is a juvenile phase during which the organism stays near the bottom of the ocean, and it uses its motor force and its adaptation to cold that it has inherited from its anaerobic ancestor. The planula after about a month from birth, descends down to the very bottom of the sea where it finds a suitable place to settle down and turn into polyp, which would morph into the medusa, the mature form. During medusa phase, cnidarians follow a daily cycle of moving up and down the depth of the top half of the ocean depth, usually during the day sinking down into the depth of the ocean away from the heat of the sun and rising to the top again at night to prey for food. Cnidarians when the environment is favourable, use sexual reproduction to disseminate sperm and egg into the water to reproduce externally. This is coordinated by light between the two sexes, and they would briefly rise to the surface of the water to disseminate their gametes. However when there is oxygen stress, which they are not so used to, they would stay and hermaphrodite, meaning two sexes in one body. So essentially, they have divided their life phase into two, and in medusa phase they also divided the phase into two, day and night using inhibitory serotonin to inhibit serotonin use during the day to move away from the light and find coldness that they are used to, and at night move up from the bottom by switching to the use of acetylcholine and dopamine. During the polyp phase in which they stay at the bottom of the ocean only using acetylcholine and dopamine to sustain horizontal movement, much like their anaerobic ancestor, who was also very adapted to the dark cold environment. Down here, the cnidarian uses gaba to endure cold stress until it turns into poly to become medusa, which shows similarity to what the primal gaba did to endure cold stress. Cnidarian has utilized the creation of inhibitory serotonin to essentially divide its life into 4 compartments, the top two of which are coordinated by serotonin and the bottom two by acetylcholine and has no distinction because it uses gaba and doesn’t need to distinguish its behaviour according to time of the day. Sexual reproduction existed before cnidarians, even before the eukaryotes, but they were simply constant switching of sexes in every individual and not a determined-sex-for-life mode. They only used gaba to endure the momentary stress that they come up against, and when that stress goes away they turn back to asexual being. By incorporating inhibitory serotonin to sexual reproduction, life now could make use of serotonin and acetylcholine simlutaneosly to adapt to both cold(temperature) and oxygen stress at the same time, as if the time has been unfolded into flat 2d surface with 2, or 4 compartments, because it can be said that at planula stage, the animal stays at the bottom rather than soaring up towards the top, which means it succumbs to gravity instead of using glutamate and flatten itself down to the ground. With the advent of inhibitory serotonin, life has truly freed itself from gaba and created a whole new emotion of transcendence and indifference to stress, because it can regulate all of them. Ever since the journey that life has taken began with the very gaba exerting enduring force on glutamate, life has always tried to evade from stress and problem and not stand up against it, but with inhibitory serotonin and honing of both serotonin and acetylcholine which regulates each oxygen and heat stresses with gaba inbetween the two extremes of each, life now truly has flattened itself to the bottom of the sea floor and overcome the stress of gravity that it always strived to overcome eversince its birth. 



Cnidarians made use of inhibitory serotonin, but it is not quite the inhibitory serotonin, 5HT1A receptor, that modern 4 legged land animals use including humans. It was a class of inhibitory serotonin, and cnidarians just comparmentalised their time of the day to differentiate their behaviour according to them. However, things took a very different turn when bilaterians came. Bilaterians were animals with symmetrical two sides of the body. Bilaterians would evolve into vertebrates that have spinal chord that runs down the center of the body to coordinate movement and neurosystems on the two sides of the body, The advent of bilaterian is very coincidental, but not accidental at all. A coral planula had come down to the bottom of the ocean and found a dinoflagellate, a eukaryote, to find niche on it to turn into a polyp. A coral is a cnidarian with a planula phase that is more serotonin driven during the day and dopamine drive during the night, which is quite the opposite of other cnidarians. Cnidarians, as explained previously, usually in medusa stage separates usage of dopamine and serotonin over day and night, and a jellyfish cnidarian planula separates serotonin and dopamine usage not during the time of the day but in phases, so that they use serotonin during the daytime to find place to settle, and at night time suppress serotonin use to settle down and inactivate motor function. Then there was another animal, a placozoan, that happened to be grazing the sea floor to feed on planktons and eukaryotic lives. This placozoan was descended from choanoflagellate, a dopamine and acetylcholine using life, and had found home at the bottom of the sea, going back to the way of life of its anaerobic ancestor that engulfed mitochondria, and became evermore like the ancestor by choosing to engulf or prey on living organisms to get energy from them. It had the first digestive tracts to uptake living organic matter and take electrons from it, use it as its used electron sink to be free of redox stress, and dispose of it using a primitive digestive tract that has sequential circuit of acetylcholine and gaba to push the food from its intake point to the outlet point. It fed on eukaryotic life to get energy, and it very much preferred a eukaryotic organism for their ability to photosynthesize to create energy from light, which the placozoans, ever since even before anaerobic bacteria but gaba, had longed and admired, because it was their sole purpose of existence. So a coral planula and a placozoan engulfer happened to cross paths on the same dinoflagellate, and due to their similarity in gene and ancestry, because both a coral and a placozoa descended directly from a eukaryotic choanoflagellate and even more so a cnidarian planula had more distinctive similarity to placozoan or its heterotrophic anaerobic ancestor than its adult form. These similarities allowed a very eventful merging of the two as the placozoan accidentally stuck to the dinoflagellate that coral planula had settled onto, and the coral planula and placozoan merged into a new being, creating a proto-bilaterian that had comparably symmetrical body. After the merging, the new organism that was created from the merge would have looked like this:























The placozoan feeds on its food by covering the ciliary side of its body towards the food source. Ciliates are the part of the eukaryotic body that is responsible for motor function and movement. This motor function was controlled by acetylcholine. By the time placozoan came in contact with the dinoflagellate and coral polyp, the dinoflagellate and polyp had already formed a symbiotic complex and have already begun exchanging metabolic products and energy sources. Dinoflagellates and other photosynthetic eukaryotes form symbiosis with coral polyp by providing them with energy sources such as amino acids, in this case glutamate. When they first merged, as the day transitioned from day to night, the eukaryotic melatonin from dinoflagellate took effect again. This melatonin, as it is secreted, creates 5 electrons and an extra half electron. These electrons neutralize the 5 electrons that were made in that day during each of the three mechanisms of metabolism, and creates a new electron for the usage during the night, making usage of a glutamate producing metabolism cycle . With its serotonin, the eukaryotic dinoflagellate has managed to create melatonin that as the day transitioned into night, would – 5 charges and - 1(1/2) and also have stabilizing effect at night, and this produced dopamine. Dopamine, at first a GPCR,  when in adult cnidarians, would take effect during the day, having the effect of 2 charges, but at night – charge towards the stabilizing direction in the new being emerged from a juvenile polyp, creating the dopamine that we know now. This glutamate had been handed over to the polyp to be used at night, and it will make a neural pathway through the part of the nerve net that uses dopamine to oppress motor function which is activated by serotonin during the daytime to arouse motor function.  The next day, when melatonin secreted, a new path way had been formed , connecting the newly formed dopamine with the serotonin of the dinoflagellate, through glutamate synthesis. By connecting its dopamine producing part of the 

net with the serotonergic part of the dinoflagellate with energy derived from the glutamate, the very first Inhibitory Serotonin receptor(5HT1A) of life was formed in coral nerve net, just next to the dopaminergic nerves. Dopamine is worth 2 gaba, same as glutamate, which was gotten by adding two gabas. A gaba produces 2 electrons from its metabolic process, so a gaba is worth 2 electrons, which means a dopamine or a glutamate is worth 4 electrons. Half of the electrons produced from metabolizing glutamate goes to producing energy and half goes to constructing the physical building blocks of the body. A glutamate was used to connect serotonin part of the dinoflagellate to the dopamine part to create Inhibitory Serotonin receptors, however half is used for generating energy, and only the half went to making the neural circuit to dopamine and this made the newly derived Inhibitory Serotonin receptor, so Inhibitory Serotonin receptor is same as Serotonin( 5 gabas) + 2 electrons(1 gaba) = 6 gabas. After the bodies merged between placozoan and the polyp, the energy produced by the gaba on the placozoan side could be transferred during the daytime to the right side through neural connection, and this extra energy would be used to survive the day. When the first energy arrived from the placozoan after merge during the day, it formed a new serotonin in the part of neural net that is in contact with the dinoflagellate, and this would have the charge value of 5 gabas and a half. Simulateneously when the sun came up, serotonin starts secreting within the body, and half the energy formed when the melatonin secreted would be used to form a nerve that connects newly formed serotonin part of the coral to the one that came up would as it starts secreting would work also towards the inactivating serotonin day part of the polyp. However immediately during that day as the day closed, the secretion of melatonin by dinoflagellate will add an electron, using half to add to the energy and stabilize the positive force that is around during the in the right half and also ‘forms a a new neural pathway connecting the newly created serotonin with the circuit that was formed during the day between placozoan acetylcholine and serotonin of dinoflagellate. 



A night has passed and the morning came. The serotonin motor part of the polyp’s body had been activated and the motor part of the placozoans body that was in contact with the newly formed glutamate-run dopamine part of the coral polyp has extended its desire to reach for serotonin and clutch today’s motivation for growth and survival has made it extend its nerve net towards the newly activated serotonergic part of the coral, and acetylcholine part of the placozoan was also connected with Coral polyp’s nerve net, and the glutamate produced from the placozoan’s own metabolizing system has yielded again 2 net electrons to construct the neural pathway towards serotonin and this also yielded a new nerve core filled with Inhibitory serotonin receptors, but this time this Inhibitory Serotonin core didn’t worth 6 gabas. In the very beginning a gaba succeeded in making a brand new primitive glutamate, an energy source, by adding another gaba which yielded a net gain of 2 extra electrons produced(gaba=2 electrons, glutamate = 4, net gain =2). When acetylcholine was first derived, it was made from adding the value of gaba and glutamate to cope with the heat stress, and this involves adding 2 electrons with the value of 4 electrons which is 6 electrons. However, the metaboliser of acetylcholine which is heterotrophic bacteria, has produced a new motive force towards a new direction by inputting a single unit of negative force from the direction of stress, which is a net gain of 2 electrons. You can put it anyway you like. Not only checking the falling of the cell by gravity after it became heavier with cell growth, but also keeping it afloat, deriving a new direction of vertical downward from the initial direction of horizontal growth, putting a halt to an accelerating object with only single negative force when in terms of physics you need not a single force but a constantly increasing force against the direction of acceleration, not only enduring heat stress but also running away from it, taking care of not only heat stress but also redox stress as well(because heterotrophic bacteria used organic compounds to dispose of its extra electrons). In anyway you like to put it, the acetylcholine using microorganism had produced two outcomes from one input. So this creation of new energy from exerting one negative force, another growth and introduction of another new dimension, had resulted from the production of acetylcholine. Also, when serotonin was made by cyanobacteria for the first time, it tried to endure oxygen stress, but it not only created a way to make use of its stress source but also create extra from it. Finally, when dopamine was created in the first motile animals, it not only resolved the problem of getting to the sexual mate, but also it allowed for the organism to get to its food source as well. However, for acetylcholine and dopamine, the dimension of the production of energy and the dimension it was used to resolve the stress was different, because the energy produced to use with acetylcholine to drive the cell forward was glutamate, which was created at night but was used during the next day, and the energy to drive motor force that would be rewarded by dopamine was also glutamate, which would be used on the same time frame as its production, but it was the first ever since the energy to produce the chemical and the usage of chemicals were on different beings(dinoflagellate and coral polyp). So in the end, the only chemicals that its the effect of positive net gain of energy irregardless of timing of the day was gaba and serotonin, an energy that biological system has managed to create out of nothing. This new inhibitory serotonin as it was created exerted a force to counter and neutralize this. Dopamine and acetylcholine would each only be potent at each day and night, and would be neutralized as the timing transitioned to the next part of the day. So, this new inhibitory serotonin had the role of neutralizing the 2 extra energy that was created by its forefathers and also doing the same for dopamine and acetylcholine by switching between them accordingly, meaning it would have default value of – 4 electrons, while in the day resolving further 2 more charges, and at night only +1, because dopamine actually worked against serotonin in the night although the direction was the same. From now on as the evolution progressed this new inhibitory serotonin would work as the primary neutralizer of all the gabaergic attack to quench electron receptors on the right side. Dinoflagellate had been stuck to the side of the coral polyp facing upward, and it had been bulging out like as if creating a height dimension towards the top. This new Inhibitory serotonin, connecting the serotonin to dopamine had also been formed on that layer had expanded the layer properly in area so that now a proper 2nd layer covered the bottom layer of the polyp.



As the sun came down, the first day of the bilaterian animal had come to a close. And again melatonin took effect, activating dopamine 





When the bilaterians first arrived, they didn’t have sexual distinction in each individuals. 

Corals are inherently resistant to low oxygen stress due to their habitat under the deep sea. However, coral polyp that merged with placozoan was a juvenile polyp, a single unit of coral. In order to for it to mature into an adult and acquire resistance to low oxygen concentration, it had to grow and form a colony. Due to merger with placozoan, the polyp could not do that, so was maintained at a constant state of being under low oxygen stress. Now the left side, the placozoan side, had sensed this constant oxygen stress felt by the polyp side, and decided to act accordingly by exerting a force for the new animal to grow into a being more resistant at oxygen stress, while also selecting individuals that are more resistant to survive. (Detecting oxygen stress with the right polyp side of the body which had more acute sensory towards oxygen stress than the placozoan side due to their) next day, a new attack path commenced from the left most part, now connecting the ancient gaba center in the placozoan’s body through the acetycholine Acetyl-Coa cycle, and towards the newly formed daytime serotonin of the polyp.within the body of placozoan itself, and creating the very first estrogen, a steroid hormone that not only has a role in sexual reproduction of organisms, but also has an emotional function of distinguishing between a proper serotonin and a lesser serotonin. This marks the beginning of left side being of a bilaterian being used to interact with other female individuals, right side used to interact with male individuals, left side used for detecting and coping with cold(temperature stress), the right used for detecting oxygen stress, and the start of active sexual selection by individuals on individuals rather than by nature on life itself. As the estrogen signal that was connected to the polyp side with the bridge of gaba and acetylcholine, it hits the right side serotonin of the polyp activated with sunrise, while a new glutamate is formed at the dinoflagellate to be used for the day. This marks the first occurrence of glutamate as a stress sensor and it would become to detect competition stress from other individuals within the same sex. When melatonin secretes at night that day, it hits back the intrusion of electrons from estrogen(gaba) and acetylcholine with the repressive force of inhibitory serotonin core, especially the surplus 1+ gaba(2 electrons) and sends this back towards the glutamate half and eventually cross to placozoan half, and on the way, it meets with the path being energized by the newly formed glutamate that day in the morning and about to perish into thin air just before sunset(tiredness).    This gives rise to another new neuromodulator, this time on right side(men’s side) first, and this is called Noradrenaline. Noradrenaline is a primary neuromodulator that deals with stress, and it allows for individuals to discriminate other members of the same sex and selectively choose objects for physical competition, thereby allowing males to relieve their own stress onto other male individuals exacerbating competition. It was formed as a both the retaliation(melatonin or Inhibitory serotonin1.5) and accordance(glutamate formed by serotonin1, or gaba). Ever since, men have been unconsciously known and have been in comtempt with women for making them compete incessantly for selection, but had to give in due to their survival instinct. This noradrenergic signal crosses the bridge made by the glutamate stress sensor over to the women’s side on the flow of dopamine that started secreting as the night came, and then makes a symmetrical Noradrenaline core on the placozoan’s side, now forcing females to also compete within their own sex for survival. This also made symmetrical glutamate stress button that stands for stress from female-female competition as they crossed over. (This newly formed Estrogen core, on the tide of dopamine within its own motor half, will be connected all the way to the latest serotonin part of the polyp half, and will produce also a new neurochemical, noradrenaline, by picking up surplus electron from the acetylcholine core of its own body.) Estrogen is used for inter sex selection and discrimination and noradrenaline for intrasex. By this time, the bilaterians have evolved from animals with only symmetry of their body in morphology but no centralized motor coordination of the both sides of the body, to a primitive vertebrate animals that have noto chords and a coordinated muscle movement switching between, glutamate(gaba) and gaba(acetylcholine) for contraction, on the left by estrogen towards the right, where the same process is coordinated by noraderenaline. With this coordinated muscle movement, basal chordate animals of which many are extinct now, could actively and physically compete with their own sexes and the members of opposite sexes would make contact with eachother physically when mating, which usually takes place after sunset. However there rose another problem. The males hit back with dopamine generated noradrenaline signal that neutralized the surplus energy from the left during the day at night and made the noradrenaline core on women’s side(just women also), but the inhibitory serotonergic(induced by melatonin on men’s side) signal sent back by the men’s side was met and carried over to the women’s side by dopamine, which at that moment had stabilizing value of 1(1/2?). So out of the 3 gabas that was sent over on the inhibitory serotonin 1.5 of the men’s side, one would neutralize dinoflagellate serotonin made gaba, and two would be sent over after the subtraction of 1/2 gaba, 1 electron, and would only receive 7 photons instead of 8, unable to fully neutralize the 4 extra electrons made during the day. So women, after handing over 1 electron over to the men’s side(to attack by inducing competition), even after melatonin involvement, due to serotonin’s photosynthesis gets handed over 1 extra photon(1/2 electron) during mating at night and grows throughout the day under cover. Since then, although men strive tirelessly to fight back to the competition that women induce among them, they cannot fully do this, and in pretention of nurturing growth and supporting humanity, they always think about themselves in the end. The women, as soon as they get this 7 photons, use the extra surplus deficiency of one photon to make progesterone, a neuromodulator that suppresses competiveness and discrimination by inferior-superiority towards the same sex individuals, and the next day, after they made 1 glutamate with gaba, they send this over to acetylcholine to generate extra gaba to send over, via the path previously made by connecting their acetylcholine and the serotonin of dinoflagellate, by making another pathway just in proximity, an androgen pathway. So the effect of retaliation by men is short lived, and women do not sustain much duration of competition among themselves, instantly repressing this with creation of progesterone. The advent of androgen marks the beginning of contrasting accordance of dexterity and cerebral use, meaning right side brain controls left and left brain controls right body. The androgen core first made on the women’s side of the body, with the acetylcholine-serotonin bridge firmly establish long before, makes androgen center that dictates the movement of the rightside, thereby cancelling the men’s effort to strike back to retaliate for their competition, but now it will be even harder to do this since they have a core in the left that governs the direction of the aggressivity of the right. However more importantly, they also plant the seed of neutralization. The half charge that is deficient is carried over to the next day, and when the morning breaks, it is not 2 electrons worth of 1 gaba, but 5 photons, an extra photon that the women started with. This photon was carried over to the next day by the dopamine that was triggered as the symmetrical noradrenaline node took shape on women’s side, and this actually carried the half charge over to the next day, also making a Inhibitory serotonin core on women’s side where the placozoa’s ciliates used for motor movement used to be. This extra half charge was used to make inhibitory dopamine, a half charge or proton worth of neuromodulator that literally inhibits dopamine use, and since it is located on the left side, it will take effect towards women. However, there is more important function to this chemical, and it is to recognize and detect space. This was the first neuromodulator to be established after getting hit back by the Inhibitory serotonin at the exact end of the body, the top outmost corner, which completed the forming of volume in the primitive bilaterian body, a 2d space. Women, as they received this retaliation and used dopamine to send it over to the next day, an act of crossing over the border between two distinct time periods of two days and not just from morning to night, has completed the expansion into 3d space and finally fulfilled their longed for dream of getting through the night without gabaergic endurance and inhibition. It also makes an inhibitory serotonin on the top compartment of left side when it crosses over to the next day towards estrogen core, diagonally adjacent to the inhibitory serotonin made just now with dopamine, meaning two different days were now connected into one timescale by space detecting D2.   However, they selfishley only planted this on their side so that men cannot use this towards themselves, among them but has to do use it towards against only women although they had just acquired the ability to plant cores on both sides of the cortex of life through androgen. Androgen is a steroid hormone related to masculinity, however in contrast to popular knowledge, it was first developed in women, by women and used most extensively by women to divert the direction of competition and attack towards them to something else, in this case back towards men. It is a selfishness hormone. In women and men’s left half, it works in tandem with D2 inhibitory dopamine receptor to oppress aggression towards women, and on men’s side it works with excitatory dopamine to induce aggression. As the androgen core is formed it crosses bridge near Acetylcholine – Serotonin Bridge at the top formed during the very first encounter between the two sides, and now with dopaminergic pathway forming strength but with inhibitory force added from D2, it forms a symmetrical Androgen core on men’s side during the daylight in another attempt to reach for the Serotonin on the right most part of men, however the half charge worth of inhibition by D2 cuts it short and instead swept away by the current of another glutamate induced run towards the night, this time without the help of the Inhibitory Serotonin 1.5, and the half charge inhibition + the melatonin induced downwards half charge addition creates a full charge inhibition. This creates a symmetrical progesterone core on men’s side, countering the androgen’s drive towards selfish revival of intrasex competition among men. By this time, life has evolved into the primitive jawless fishes, the descendents of whom can be seen in examples such as Lampreys and Hagfish that still survive to this day. These fishes have rigorous motor function and muscle movement, but they are not so well coordinated on both sides due to Estrogen that coordinates the acetylcholine and serotonin only existing on the left side. They also only have one nose, which stands for having only one androgen and norandrenaline core in the brain that senses competition and opportunistically looks for ways to exploit competition’s weaknesses, in other words, smelling blood, although the trigger for noradrenaline and androgen exist on both sides of the bodies,. Hagfish is a scavenger who feeds on dead animals and lampreys feed on blood. They predate on extra-species preys, but are not yet capable of hunting or attacking them with their own might. They have one sexual gland in the middle, meaning one gland. Lampreys have delicate nesting behaviour used to attract females, which means they use d2 inhibitory dopamine towards women, and they do this just when sun starts to goes down meaning melatonin induced progesterone behaviour that is not actively competitive towards other males. Hagfish is more competitive among same sex individuals and even the females compete among themselves, this shows that Hagfish does not have the neural pathway of progesterone and d2 to suppress intrasex aggression. It also explains why hagfish is completely blind and lampreys has eyes. The right side progesterone forms a brand new Inhibitory serotonin, this time on the top compartment just above the inhibitory serotonin that formed for the very first time connecting dinoflagellate serotonin and dopamine. This is located in the top compartment, the daytime floor, and inhibits daytime competition between males through progesterone by inhibiting noradrenaline. Progesterone also inactivates the glutamate stress button, located asymmetrically only on men’s side, meaning by using progesterone to suppress male-male competition, they were free of intrasex competition stress and all their stress from other living beings was terminated for time being. After the glutamate excitation is oppressed by progesterone, it is sent back over to the female side using the pathway that connects two noradrenaline cores. It tries to punish the females by inducing competition again through heading for the estrogen core again, but is again halted by the half charge inhibition of progesterone and only succeeds in leaving a mark with a newly formed neuromodulator, testosterone. Testosterone is another steroid, and is used to display aggression towards extra-species individuals, and this case it is against females supposing in this case that intra-species mean within males. As the attack keeps on getting halted by progesterone and D2 on females itself, males resort to attacking females offspring, giving birth to life’s first infanticide. Infanticide, first seen in jawed fishes, is not a display of aggression to subdue other males and harm their lineage, but to punish women for their manipulation that induces competition among males. This attack however leaves a trauma on women, producing a Cortisol button, as this time the males infanticidal attacks were taken place during daytime and it cortisol was formed using d2 inhibitory pathway that inhibited women-women competition, meaning although males attacked their infants they did not resort to fighting among themselves or relieving the stress on eachother. They truly saw men as inferior. With the advent of cortisol, the stress from another individual had returned although it was not intras—sex but extrasex this time and also women started feeling stress from higher women,(was estrogen formed around this time?) by higher women this can either mean the natural environment, survival of their lineage or genes, or higher or more confident or more serotonergic women.  The core then sends over extra gaba to run the glutamate cycle next day, through a new pathway.

First day -> dopamine(just before sunset -1 charge)  glutamate(in the morning +4 charge) and connection. 글루타밋 만드는데 plp한번 -> 4 photons  -> 2 photons used for metabolism, 2 used for energy -> 2 makes 5 but only 4 gets emitted during the day, 2 will used to make glutamate and 1 to get to melatonin core -> just before sunset melatonin released unleashing 1 extra photon and 1 photon is used to make plp cycle and 1 photon is used to run it, creating dopamine that is(-1 a minus force, -1 that counters cold, -1 in another being, -1 at night) -> melatonin signals placozoan merge -> placozoan merge

2nd day  -> right in the morning just before sunrise, placozoan acetylc coa runs and creates 4(5) photons -> (1 used to send over), 1 used to make the nerve to Serotonin(to get to melatonin for energy source during daytime because wome only make energy at night and melatonin allows for creatures to make energy during the day without light) , (1 used power(control) the cycle), 1 put in the cycle( 1 used to counter tiredness), 1 used to not counter tired but the energy that comes out from the plp in serotonin used 1 to power , duplicate , make the plp now run in photon in women’s body as well, bring plp back(?) to acetylcholine, 1 to make the pathway back to acetyl reducta 1 to put in that pathway , 1 to get rid of serotonin just before sunrise(with gaba from its own body and life terminates in algae but also creates a new energy just before life leaves algae to run the plp in acetyl, which creates 4 protons, 1 to make a bridge from serotonin to glutamate, 1 to duplicate plp in glutamate to make a new serotonin, 1 to run it , 1 to run back towards glutamate to escape(can now use energy to escape death) -> Now melatonin can still be produced without algae alive. ) - > melatonin core in the middle feed on algae, 1 to rebuild it get rid of it acquire a plp within acetylcholine 4 photons made 2 used to power nergy 2 used to get to dopamine core 1 used to run it, when melatonin comes 1 photon used to make inhibitory serotonin.

Before women perishes at day it uses all 4 electrons 



So do women have the ability to understand that circuit -> tiredness



So in the end women had to keep men’s side alive because it had already become part of it .

Acetyl no plp during night, yes plp during day.

Acetyl – serotonin pathway during the night(PROBABLY JUST JUST BEFORE SUNRISE)+, just before sunrise -, after sunrise +

Acetyl – glutamate -> night-, just before sunrise +, after sunrise -.

Serotonin -glutamate pathway just before sunrise (-), after sunrise(+)



the one made by algae to send back to serotonin was a 5 photon one, extra photon sent back to making gaba, ( the one extra photon making plp, during sunrise)





The new serotonin core will now be used by electron, not photon, melatonin producing ability retains, glutamate producing function moves down, produces melatonin until sunset, this photon moves over to glutamate at sunrise, runs glutamate cycle,
