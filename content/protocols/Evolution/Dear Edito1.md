# Dear Edito1

Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit my hypothesis article entitled "The Leaky Fortress: Osteoporosis as a Biophysical Driver of Senile Leukemia" for consideration in BioEssays.

This paper proposes a novel solution to the "age paradox" of leukemia. While current models focus on stochastic mutations, they fail to explain why leukemia rates track so closely with skeletal aging. I propose a biophysical mechanism: that the bone matrix functions as a piezoelectric and dielectric "shield" that maintains the hypoxic stem cell niche. I argue that osteoporosis is a mechanical breach of this shield, leading to an "oxygen leak" that drives oxidative stress and malignancy.

This hypothesis bridges the fields of bone mechanics, oncology, and bioenergetics, fitting perfectly with BioEssays' mission to publish forward-looking, transdisciplinary perspectives.

I confirm this work is original and not under consideration elsewhere.

Sincerely,
Il Woong Choi→↑←↓
