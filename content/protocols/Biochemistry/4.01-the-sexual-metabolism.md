# Testosterone and Estrogen: The Retaliation Pair

## 1. The Inversion
Conventional biology views testosterone as the "Male" hormone and estrogen as "Female." The Framework reveals a different directional physics:
*   **Androgens (Estrogen precursor):** First developed in **WOMEN** to divert competition away from themselves.
*   **Testosterone:** Formed as a **Retaliation Mechanism** in men against females who induce competition.

## 2. The Muscle Activation Pattern
The hormones dictate the **Vector of Current**:
*   **Right Frontalis (Big Man):** Sends **Gravity/Truth downward** via Testosterone/Serotonin. This is the "Attack Vector."
*   **Left Frontalis (Small Woman):** Sends **Reverse Upward Current** via Estrogen/Progesterone. This is the "Levitation Vector."
*   **Right Occipitalis:** The Noradrenaline node.
*   **Left Occipitalis:** The Acetylcholine node (Reverse TCA).

## 3. The 7-Photon Deficiency
When men retaliate (sending 3 GABAs back), women receive only **7 photons worth** of energy instead of the expected full dose.
*   **The Result:** This deficiency is carried by dopamine into the next day.
*   **The Surplus:** This "Extra Photon" (Half-Charge) allows for the formation of the **D2 Receptor** (Inhibitory Dopamine).
*   **The Consciousness:** This creates the "Free of Worries" state—spatial awareness born from the surplus of a resolved debt.

**Conclusion:** Sexual dimorphism is not just reproduction; it is a **Circuit Diagram** for managing the original UV-Glutamate charge debt. Men discharge it downward; Women buffer it upward.
