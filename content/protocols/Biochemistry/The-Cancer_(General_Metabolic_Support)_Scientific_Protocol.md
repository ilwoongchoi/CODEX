Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Cancer (General Metabolic Support) via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for Cancer (General Metabolic Support) focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: The Warburg Effect (Glycolytic Shift). We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Cancer is a metabolic disease, not a genetic bad luck. The mitochondria fail, forcing the cell to ferment sugar for energy (Warburg Effect). Cancer cells CANNOT use oxygen and CANNOT use fat.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Cancer (General Metabolic Support) cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of The Warburg Effect (Glycolytic Shift) initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

Cancer is a metabolic disease, not a genetic bad luck. The mitochondria fail, forcing the cell to ferment sugar for energy (Warburg Effect). Cancer cells CANNOT use oxygen and CANNOT use fat.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Starvation (Glucose)

Protocol: Ketogenic Diet + Metformin (or Berberine).
Biophysical Mechanism: Removes the primary fuel (Sugar). Forces the body to run on Fat, which the cancer cell cannot metabolize.

2.2 Target 2: The Oxygen (Pressure)

Protocol: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT).
Biophysical Mechanism: Forces oxygen into the tumor. Cancer is anaerobic; oxygen is toxic to it. It reverses the hypoxic environment.

2.3 Target 3: The Terrain (pH)

Protocol: Alkaline Buffering (Bicarbonate).
Biophysical Mechanism: Cancer creates an acidic halo to dissolve surrounding tissue. Neutralizing this acid stops the invasion.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Cancer (General Metabolic Support) becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores the The Starvation (Glucose), clears the The Oxygen (Pressure), and resets the The Terrain (pH). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
