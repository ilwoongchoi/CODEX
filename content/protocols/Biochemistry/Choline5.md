Abstract

Cancer and Alzheimer's disease represent two prevalent age-related pathologies exhibiting a striking inverse epidemiological relationship. This paper proposes a unified metabolic framework linking both diseases through dysregulation of the choline-GABA-alpha-ketoglutarate axis. We hypothesize that individuals with deficient GABAergic regulation systems (both ionotropic GABA-A and metabotropic GABA-B) accumulate alpha-ketoglutarate ("cold stress") and experience circadian-dependent charge dysregulation ("darkness stress"), creating permissive conditions for either oncogenic transformation or neurodegenerative autoimmunity. Cancer emerges when epinephrine-mediated proliferative signaling proceeds without proper inhibitory control, manifesting as outward-directed pathology through uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Alzheimer's disease emerges when vasopressin-mediated stress responses cannot discharge externally, redirecting pathology inward as autoimmune-like neurodegeneration. Central to both mechanisms is the energetic equivalence between dual-GABA system deficiency and impaired choline synthesis via S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent pathways. This framework integrates established hallmarks—metabolic reprogramming, circadian disruption, genomic instability, cholinergic deficiency, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex dysfunction—into a testable model explaining why these diseases rarely co-occur despite shared metabolic vulnerabilities, and predicting unified therapeutic approaches targeting metabolic restoration and chronotherapeutic optimization.

Introduction

The inverse epidemiological relationship

Multiple large-scale studies report a robust inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cancer survivors show a substantially reduced risk of incident AD—for example, in the Framingham cohort, prior cancer was associated with roughly one-third lower AD risk, with even stronger protection for smoking-related cancers. Autopsy series similarly find markedly lower cancer prevalence in AD brains compared with age-matched controls. Meta-analytic syntheses converge on this pattern: across cohorts, AD patients exhibit reduced cancer incidence, and individuals with cancer histories demonstrate a lower risk of subsequent AD.

This inverse relationship appears across methodologies—prospective cohorts, meta-analyses, and autopsy studies—making it unlikely to be fully explained by under-diagnosis or competing mortality. In particular, findings from neuropathological series, which are not subject to clinical diagnostic bias, strongly suggest that cancer and AD reflect partially opposing biological states.

Current disease models: parallel deficiencies

In oncology, metabolic reprogramming is a core hallmark of malignant transformation. One of the most consistent signatures across tumor types is altered choline metabolism: elevated phosphocholine and total choline-containing compounds reflect enhanced phosphatidylcholine synthesis supporting rapid membrane biogenesis. Epidemiological and experimental work also implicates circadian disruption—such as night-shift work and light-at-night exposure—as a risk factor for several cancers.

In contrast, AD research emphasizes cholinergic failure. The cholinergic hypothesis links progressive loss of acetylcholine-containing neurons and reduced choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity to cognitive decline. Mitochondrial metabolism is also impaired: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) activity is reduced by 50–75% in AD-vulnerable regions, often preceding overt neurodegeneration. Clinically, AD is accompanied by profound circadian disruption—sundowning and sleep–wake fragmentation—pointing to a shared vulnerability of temporal regulation.

Hypothesis

Cancer and AD can be interpreted as alternative manifestations of a shared upstream metabolic vulnerability rooted in dual GABAergic regulatory deficiency—simultaneous impairment of ionotropic (GABA) and metabotropic (GABA) inhibitory control. Loss of these complementary regulators creates two coupled physiological deficits: metabolic dysregulation of α-ketoglutarate and KGDHC function, and circadian vulnerability due to failure of nocturnal, GABA-linked entrainment. Depending on tissue context and modulators such as genetics and stress exposure, this unstable configuration resolves either into outward, proliferative discharge (cancer) or inward, degenerative collapse (AD).

Central to this view is the role of choline synthesis via S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)–dependent phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation, which constitutes a major SAM sink and links membrane biogenesis, methylation capacity, and energy metabolism. Both GABAergic regulation and SAM-dependent choline synthesis involve internal electron redistribution without net redox change, implying an energetic equivalence: dual GABAergic failure functionally mimics impaired choline-synthesis capacity. In this framework, the cholinergic deficit of AD and the choline-rich “cholinic phenotype” of tumors arise as opposite responses to the same underlying regulatory imbalance. The inverse epidemiology thus reflects mutual exclusivity: once the system tips into a proliferative or degenerative attractor, metabolic resources are captured by that trajectory, making concurrent development of the other pathology unlikely.



The Choline–SAM–Methylation Axis and Disease Vulnerability

SAM-dependent choline synthesis

De novo choline synthesis proceeds via sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), consuming three molecules of SAM per PC formed. This route is a major consumer of cellular SAM and consists entirely of methyl-transfer steps without net external redox exchange. Because PEMT activity draws heavily on SAM, any limitation in one-carbon metabolism directly constrains endogenous choline synthesis and PC availability for membranes and acetylcholine. Genetic variants in PEMT and folate-dependent enzymes determine the balance between this endogenous route and dietary choline uptake; when PEMT capacity is low, dependence on dietary choline increases, and conversely, choline deficiency increases PEMT demand and SAM consumption.

Choline dysregulation in cancer: the “cholinic phenotype”

Activated choline metabolism is a recurrent feature of carcinogenesis. Tumors characteristically show elevated phosphocholine and total choline-containing compounds, a pattern termed the “cholinic phenotype.” This reflects coordinated enzymatic changes: upregulated choline kinase-α (CHKα), increased transporter expression, and altered phospholipase activity.

CHKα catalyzes the phosphorylation of free choline to phosphocholine, the first committed step of the Kennedy pathway. In many tumors, CHKα overexpression and homodimerization drive sustained phosphocholine accumulation and high PC flux for membrane biogenesis. Parallel choline oxidation to betaine supports SAM regeneration, linking choline availability to epigenetic state. The combination of global DNA hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation in cancer is consistent with dysregulated SAM-dependent methylation flux: choline is abundant for membranes, but methylation control is misallocated.

Choline deficiency and cholinergic collapse in Alzheimer’s disease

In AD, the dominant picture is the failure of cholinergic signaling. The cholinergic hypothesis links severe degeneration of cholinergic neurons and marked reductions in ChAT activity to cognitive impairment. This deficit extends beyond neuron loss to include altered choline transport, reduced acetylcholine release, and impaired trophic support.

Dietary data support a contribution of choline status: higher intake correlates with better cognitive performance, whereas simple supplementation in established AD yields limited benefit, suggesting an upstream metabolic bottleneck rather than substrate shortage. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which sustain continuous high-demand acetylcholine synthesis, appear particularly vulnerable when choline synthesis or utilization is compromised. This is consistent with a primary metabolic insult to the choline axis—an inability to maintain flux despite adequate substrate—rather than a purely downstream consequence of neurodegeneration.

Within this hypothesis, cancer and AD occupy opposite ends of the same choline–SAM–GABA vulnerability: tumors exploit an over-activated choline/SAM axis for proliferation, whereas AD expresses the collapse of cholinergic output because metabolic capacity to synthesize and deploy choline is compromised.

GABA Systems: Dual Regulation and Metabolic Integration

Ionotropic and metabotropic GABA systems
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediates inhibition through two mechanistically distinct receptor classes. Ionotropic GABA receptors function as ligand-gated chloride channels producing fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Metabotropic GABA receptors signal through G-protein-coupled mechanisms with slower kinetics, modulating calcium and potassium channels to exert broad control over neuronal and metabolic state.

Beyond neurotransmission, GABA feeds directly into intermediary metabolism through the GABA shunt, an alternative pathway bypassing the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) in the TCA cycle. Glutamate decarboxylase converts glutamate to GABA, which is subsequently catabolized to succinate, re-entering the TCA cycle downstream of KGDHC. Disruption of this shunt experimentally elevates α-ketoglutarate while reducing downstream intermediates, demonstrating that GABA signaling regulates carbon flow through central energy pathways.

Regulation of α-ketoglutarate and circadian entrainment
α-Ketoglutarate occupies a critical metabolic junction, partitioning carbon between oxidation for ATP, biosynthesis, and epigenetic regulation via α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. We propose that functional GABA signaling buffers α-ketoglutarate levels by channeling excess glutamate-derived carbon into succinate when KGDHC is limiting. Loss of this buffering allows α-ketoglutarate to accumulate, disrupting mitochondrial function and epigenetic homeostasis.

GABA signaling is also embedded in circadian regulation. Metabotropic GABA receptors contribute to the entrainment of cellular metabolism to light–dark cycles, helping coordinate when anabolic versus catabolic processes dominate. If this function is impaired, temporal coordination degrades, leading to abnormal nocturnal metabolism and increased sensitivity to phase transitions. This mirrors the circadian disruption observed in both cancer (e.g., shift-work risk) and Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., sundowning), where normal nocturnal melatonin signaling is compromised.

Energetic coupling to choline synthesis
A key link to the choline/SAM axis is energetic form. SAM-dependent methylation involves sequential methyl transfers without net external redox change—internal charge redistribution. Similarly, GABAergic regulation operates through ion-flux control and shunt redirection, also without large net oxidation–reduction. Because they share this energetic character, we propose that dual GABA deficiency and impaired SAM-dependent choline synthesis represent energetically equivalent failures. When resources are constrained, the cell cannot support both robust inhibitory regulation and high-flux methylation, creating a shared vulnerability that underlies both cholinergic collapse (AD) and metabolic permissiveness (cancer).

Cancer: Metabolic Permissiveness and Unchecked Proliferation

Dual GABA deficiency and oncogenesis
Individuals with impaired ionotropic and metabotropic GABA function exhibit a phenotype characterized by metabolic instability (α-ketoglutarate dysregulation) and circadian vulnerability. This creates a permissive background for oncogenesis. Impaired control of α-ketoglutarate promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability, while circadian disruption compromises the nocturnal coordination of DNA repair and immune surveillance.

This phenotype explains why shift workers, who experience chronic circadian misalignment, show elevated risk for breast and colorectal cancers. It also explains why tumor growth often retains circadian rhythmicity: the loss of GABA-mediated entrainment expands temporal windows where protective mechanisms (checkpoints, repair) fail to engage effectively.

Epinephrine-driven proliferation without inhibitory balance
In normal physiology, growth-promoting adrenergic signals are counterbalanced by GABAergic inhibition, producing oscillatory control over proliferation. In a dual-GABA-deficient state, this balance is lost. Epinephrine and related signals can continuously activate cyclic AMP–dependent transcription factors (CREB, AP-1) and glycolytic pathways. Without GABAergic opposition, these pro-growth signals become constitutive rather than rhythmic.

This represents a “misdirected stress response”: energy mobilized for outward interaction cannot be discharged behaviorally and is instead channeled into internal cellular processes. In malignant tissue, this manifests as persistent, cell-autonomous growth and “addiction” to growth signals. Melatonin, the hormonal signal of darkness, normally exerts anti-proliferative effects, but its efficacy depends partly on functional GABAergic machinery; thus, melatonin supplementation alone may not fully reverse the proliferative drive if the underlying GABA deficiency remains unaddressed.

Cholinergic System Collapse: Metabolic Insufficiency Becoming Structural Failure

The marked degeneration of the cholinergic system in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—reduced choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and basal forebrain neuron loss—represents the structural endpoint of a chronic metabolic insufficiency along the choline–GABA–SAM axis. Long-standing limitations in endogenous choline synthesis and energy production, combined with impaired inhibitory and circadian regulation, eventually exceed the capacity of cholinergic neurons to sustain synaptic function.

Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are uniquely vulnerable due to extreme metabolic demands: continuous choline supply for acetylcholine, SAM for membrane and gene regulation, and robust mitochondrial ATP generation. In a state of impaired mitochondrial function and limited choline/SAM flux, these neurons fail early, consistent with the observation that cholinergic and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDHC) deficits precede overt dementia. This vulnerability explains why acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide only symptomatic relief: they transiently increase synaptic acetylcholine but cannot restore the underlying metabolic capacity necessary to sustain the neuron.

Hypothesis Testing

Biomarker predictions
We predict distinct metabolic signatures: Cancer should exhibit a “growth profile” characterized by elevated phosphocholine and reduced GABAergic tone. AD should show a “degeneration profile” with depleted choline availability and reduced GABAergic activity. Longitudinal metabolomics should reveal divergent nocturnal α-ketoglutarate/succinate ratios reflecting differences in how the shared failure of inhibitory–metabolic regulation is resolved.

Genetic associations
High-activity PEMT variants (enhanced choline synthesis) should increase cancer risk but protect against AD. Conversely, low-activity PEMT alleles should increase AD risk but limit tumor growth. Loss-of-function GABA receptor variants (GABRA, GABRB) likely increase risk for both, with the proliferative versus degenerative outcome determined by metabolic context.

Clinical interventions
Metabolic interventions may have opposing effects: choline or SAMe supplementation supports AD cognition but could fuel tumor growth in existing malignancies. Conversely, GABAergic agonists should be therapeutic for both (suppressing proliferation in cancer, reducing neuroinflammation in AD). Circadian-based therapies—timed light exposure and sleep regularization—are critical for restoring nocturnal regulation in both conditions.

Implications

Unified prevention strategies
Prevention should target upstream resilience rather than organ-specific endpoints. Key elements include: (1) circadian hygiene (regular sleep–wake patterns, minimizing light at night) to preserve nocturnal repair; (2) metabolic support that limits insulin resistance and maintains one-carbon metabolism; and (3) stress management to limit chronic adrenergic activation that cannot be balanced by compromised inhibitory systems.

Chronotherapy and timing
Timing is a primary therapeutic variable. Interventions targeting GABAergic or metabolic pathways may require evening administration to restore lost nocturnal control. Optimizing when choline or melatonin is given relative to circadian phase could determine whether they reinforce physiological rhythms or destabilize them.

Reframing disease classifications
Classifying age-related diseases by metabolic failure mode (e.g., “inhibitory–metabolic deficiency with proliferative vs. degenerative expression”) rather than organ system could accelerate therapeutic translation between oncology and neurology.

Conclusion

Alzheimer’s disease and cancer represent mirror expressions of a shared origin: chronic dual GABAergic deficiency coupled to impaired SAM-dependent choline synthesis and circadian disruption. The inverse epidemiological relationship reflects mutual exclusivity: an unstable energetic state resolves into either unrestrained proliferation (cancer) or degenerative collapse (AD). By shifting focus from downstream lesions to these upstream inhibitory, metabolic, and circadian failures, it may become possible to devise unified strategies that reduce the incidence of both pathologies.
