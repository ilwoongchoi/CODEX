Abstract
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), particularly Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), presents a persistent metabolic paradox. While monoaminergic theories focus on serotonin and norepinephrine, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies consistently reveal a distinct bioenergetic signature in TRD patients: elevated cerebral lactate alongside profound deficits in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Current neuroenergetic models, such as the Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle (ANLS), posit that lactate serves as a preferred oxidative fuel for neurons. This creates a contradiction: why does the depressed brain, which is ostensibly awash in lactate fuel, fail to power its inhibitory interneurons? This paper proposes the Lactate-GABA Shuttle Hypothesis, which reframes this anomaly not as fuel abundance, but as oxidative failure. It is hypothesized that TRD represents a functional block in the Forward TCA Cycle, driven by a critical reduction in the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio ("Reductive Stress"). This redox imbalance stalls the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate and, crucially, inhibits the NAD+-dependent enzymes of the GABA Shunt (specifically Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase). Consequently, the brain becomes trapped in a "Metabolic Stalemate": potential energy is sequestered in anabolic intermediates (lactate) rather than recycled into the glutamate-glutamine cycle necessary for GABA synthesis. This paper synthesizes evidence from immunometabolism, neurochemistry, and mitochondrial physiology to propose that restoring the NAD+ redox potential—rather than targeting receptor binding—is the key to unlocking the metabolic deadlock of refractory depression.

Keywords: Treatment-Resistant Depression, Lactate Metabolism, GABA Shunt, NAD+/NADH Ratio, Reductive Stress, Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle, Immunometabolism.



1. Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, yet up to 30% of patients fail to respond to conventional monoaminergic antidepressants 1. This subset, termed Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), suggests pathophysiological mechanisms that extend beyond simple neurotransmitter deficits. In recent decades, the focus has shifted toward neuroenergetics—the study of how the brain generates and utilizes energy to support neuronal function 2.

The brain is an energetically expensive organ, consuming 20% of the body's glucose despite representing only 2% of its mass 3. The majority of this energy supports the repolarization of membrane potentials following synaptic transmission, particularly in glutamatergic and GABAergic networks. It is therefore significant that TRD is consistently associated with metabolic abnormalities localized to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)—regions critical for emotional regulation4. 

1.1 The Lactate Anomaly in Depression

A robust finding in the neuroimaging literature is the elevation of cerebral lactate in patients with MDD and Bipolar Disorder. Under normal physiological conditions, brain lactate levels are tightly regulated (~0.5-1.0 mM), rising transiently only during intense neuronal activation or hypoxia 5. However, 1H-MRS studies have repeatedly demonstrated elevated resting-state lactate in the gray matter of depressed patients 6.

Historically, lactate accumulation was viewed as a sign of anaerobic glycolysis or mitochondrial dysfunction (the "Warburg Effect"). More recent models, such as the Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle (ANLS), suggest that astrocytes produce lactate from glucose to fuel neurons during periods of high demand 8. In this context, elevated lactate in TRD is paradoxical: if lactate is a fuel, its accumulation implies either excessive production (hyper-metabolism) or, more likely, failed utilization (hypo-metabolism). Given that TRD is often characterized by "brain fog," psychomotor retardation, and reduced functional connectivity 9, the latter explanation—failed oxidation—appears more plausible.

1.2 The GABAergic Deficit

Concurrent with lactate elevation, TRD is marked by a specific deficit in the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. Meta-analyses of 1H-MRS studies show reduced GABA concentrations in the occipital, prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices of depressed patients compared to healthy controls 10. This deficit is functionally significant: GABAergic interneurons, particularly Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) fast-spiking cells, are essential for generating gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz) that synchronize cortical activity 12.The loss of GABAergic tone leads to cortical disinhibition, "noisy" processing, and the cognitive fragmentation seen in severe depression.
PV+ GABAergic interneurons are among the most metabolically demanding neurons in the cortex, requiring continuous ATP supply to sustain high-frequency firing and gamma oscillations 12. Elevated cerebral lactate has been repeatedly demonstrated in mood disorders, including bipolar depression and panic-related states, indicating altered energy metabolism in these same networks 6. Depressed patients also show robust reductions in cortical GABA levels in occipital and prefrontal regions10. Subsequent work has confirmed that these GABA deficits extend to anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices and correlate with symptom severity 11. Large-scale network analyses show that these metabolically and GABAergically abnormal regions form part of the same dysfunctional mood-regulation circuits 9. This spatial and functional overlap suggests that elevated lactate and reduced GABA are not independent findings but different expressions of a shared underlying metabolic disturbance 20



1.3 The Unresolved Metabolic Paradox

Current literature treats these two findings—high lactate and low GABA—as separate phenomena. The ANLS model explains lactate transport, while glutamate-glutamine cycling models explain GABA synthesis. However, few frameworks integrate them. This paper proposes a unified mechanism: that the accumulation of lactate and the failure of GABA synthesis are downstream consequences of a single upstream failure—Reductive Stress.

I hypothesize that a low cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio blocks the entry of lactate into the TCA cycle and simultaneously inhibits the GABA Shunt pathway. This creates a distinct metabolic phenotype: a brain that is high in potential energy (Lactate) but low in functional inhibition (GABA), unable to transition from an "anabolic/growth" state to a "catabolic/oxidative" state.



2. The Biochemical Mechanism of the Lactate-GABA Shuttle Failure

The core of this hypothesis rests on the bioenergetic link between lactate oxidation and GABAergic flux, mediated by the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox couple. I argue that Reductive Stress (an abnormally low NAD+/NADH ratio) creates two critical blockages that precipitate the metabolic stalemate of Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD).

2.1 Reductive Stress Blocks Lactate Oxidation via Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)

The first point of failure is the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, the primary substrate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This reaction, catalyzed by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), is fully reversible and its direction is determined by the law of mass action and the relative concentrations of NAD+ and NADH 13.

The reaction is as follows:
Lactate + NAD+ ↔ Pyruvate + NADH + H+

Under normal aerobic conditions, the NAD+/NADH ratio is high (approx. 700:1 in the cytosol), driving the reaction forward towards pyruvate production 14. However, in conditions associated with TRD, such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, this ratio plummets. This "Reductive Stress" shifts the equilibrium of the LDH reaction to the left, favoring the conversion of pyruvate to lactate 15.

The consequence is a metabolic "cul-de-sac":

Glucose is processed through glycolysis to pyruvate.

In the face of low NAD+, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is impaired, preventing pyruvate's conversion to Acetyl-CoA.

Pyruvate is shunted towards lactate production to regenerate the small amount of NAD+ needed to keep glycolysis running.

Lactate accumulates in the cytosol, unable to be re-oxidized to pyruvate.

The brain, therefore, becomes trapped in a state of aerobic glycolysis, burning glucose inefficiently to produce lactate, which cannot then be used as fuel. This explains the paradoxical finding of high lactate in a non-hypoxic, resting brain 6.



2.1.5 The NAD+ Pool as a Shared Limiting Resource

The cytosolic NAD+ pool forms a common redox currency that must be shared among all NAD+-dependent enzymes within the cell 14. Lactate dehydrogenase depends on an adequate NAD+/NADH ratio to oxidize lactate to pyruvate rather than drive the reverse reaction 13. Under conditions of reductive stress, this ratio collapses and LDH activity becomes biased toward lactate production instead of pyruvate generation15. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase in the GABA shunt is similarly dependent on NAD+ availability for its oxidative step18. When NAD+ is scarce, SSADH activity falls and succinic semialdehyde accumulates, disrupting GABA recycling 19. Taken together, these observations indicate that a single constraint—the limited cytosolic NAD+ pool—simultaneously throttles both lactate oxidation and GABA shunt flux when it is driven into a reduced state 14.



2.2 The GABA Shunt as an NAD+-Dependent Pathway

The second, more critical failure occurs within the GABA recycling pathway itself. The GABA Shunt is a closed-loop metabolic pathway that allows GABA to be recycled back into the TCA cycle, conserving carbon skeletons and replenishing glutamate pools 16. This shunt bypasses two steps of the standard TCA cycle.

The key steps are:

GABA Transaminase (GABA-T): An enzyme that converts GABA and α-Ketoglutarate into Succinic Semialdehyde (SSA) and Glutamate.

Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase (SSADH): The critical enzyme that oxidizes SSA into Succinate, which then re-enters the TCA cycle.

The activity of SSADH is absolutely dependent on NAD+ as an electron acceptor 18:
Succinic Semialdehyde + NAD+ + H2O → Succinate + NADH + H+

The Chokepoint in TRD:
In the state of Reductive Stress (low NAD+/NADH), SSADH activity is severely inhibited 18. This creates a "dam" in the GABA Shunt.

SSA accumulates in the cell. As a highly reactive aldehyde, it can cause significant oxidative damage.

The accumulation of SSA and Glutamate creates product inhibition that reverses the GABA-T reaction, preventing the breakdown of GABA.

This backlog prevents the conversion of Glutamate to GABA by Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD67), as the entire glutamate-glutamine-GABA cycle seizes up 19.

Therefore, the brain cannot synthesize new GABA and cannot efficiently recycle existing GABA. The result is a net depletion of the functional GABA pool, leading to the inhibitory deficits observed in TRD 20. The lactate is not the cause of the GABA deficit; rather, the underlying Reductive Stress is the common cause of both lactate accumulation and GABAergic failure.

This GABA shunt failure feeds back onto upstream energy metabolism. Under normal circumstances, strong GABAergic tone limits excessive glutamatergic firing and thereby constrains the cortical ATP demand curve 12. The glutamate–glutamine cycle efficiently couples excitatory transmission to astrocytic uptake and recycling when energy supply is adequate 17. When GABA levels fall, pyramidal neurons fire more frequently and for longer durations, increasing reliance on glycolysis to meet the heightened ATP requirement 2. Functional imaging studies in depression show altered glucose utilization patterns consistent with this elevated metabolic load in mood-relevant regions 4. Increased glycolytic flux drives more pyruvate production, which in a reduced NAD+ environment is preferentially converted to lactate rather than entering the TCA cycle13. This mechanism explains why resting-state lactate can remain elevated in the absence of hypoxia in mood disorders6. At the same time, low NAD+ directly impairs SSADH, preventing efficient clearance of GABA shunt intermediates 18. Thus, NAD+ depletion and GABA depletion mutually reinforce a state in which lactate accumulates, inhibition fails, and cortical networks remain locked in a high-demand but energetically inefficient mode 14

3. Evidence Integration and Clinical Correlates

Having established the theoretical biochemical mechanism, I now synthesize the empirical evidence linking Reductive Stress to the clinical phenomenology of Treatment-Resistant Depression.

3.1 Direct Evidence: Elevated Lactate and Reduced GABA in TRD

Multiple independent 1H-MRS studies have confirmed the metabolic signature I propose.

Lactate Elevation:
A landmark study by Dager et al. (2004) used 1H-MRS to measure lactate in medication-free patients with Bipolar Disorder during depressive episodes. They found a statistically significant elevation in basal ganglia lactate compared to controls, which normalized during euthymic states 6. Crucially, this lactate elevation was not associated with hypoxia or increased cerebral blood flow, suggesting a primary metabolic rather than vascular etiology.

Similarly, Maddock et al. (2016) demonstrated that patients with panic disorder—a condition with high comorbidity with MDD—showed exaggerated lactate responses to neural activation tasks 7. This hyper-responsiveness suggests an impaired capacity to oxidize lactate under metabolic demand.

GABA Reduction:
The GABAergic deficit has been replicated across multiple cohorts. Sanacora et al. (1999) first reported a 52% reduction in occipital cortex GABA in depressed patients 10. Subsequent work by Hasler et al. (2007) extended this finding to the prefrontal cortex and demonstrated that GABA levels correlated inversely with symptom severity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 11. Meta-analyses confirm that this is a robust and specific finding in MDD, particularly in treatment-resistant cases 20.

3.2 The Immunometabolic Driver: Inflammation and NAD+ Depletion

What drives the Reductive Stress? The answer lies in chronic, low-grade inflammation—a hallmark of TRD. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) are consistently elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of depressed patients 21.

The Kynurenine Pathway Diversion:
Inflammation activates Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO), which diverts Tryptophan away from Serotonin synthesis and towards the Kynurenine Pathway 22. While this pathway can theoretically produce NAD+ via Quinolinic Acid, chronic activation paradoxically depletes NAD+ due to several factors:

PARP Activation: Inflammatory oxidative stress causes DNA damage, activating Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP), which consumes vast amounts of NAD+ for DNA repair 23.

CD38 Upregulation: CD38, a NAD+-degrading enzyme, is upregulated in microglia and astrocytes during neuroinflammation, further depleting NAD+ pools 24.

Quinolinic Acid Neurotoxicity: Quinolinic Acid, a metabolite of the Kynurenine Pathway, is an NMDA receptor agonist that induces excitotoxicity, further damaging mitochondria and impairing oxidative capacity 25.

This creates a vicious cycle: inflammation depletes NAD+ → Reductive Stress blocks lactate oxidation and GABA recycling → Loss of GABAergic tone disinhibits the HPA axis → Hypercortisolemia perpetuates inflammation.


3.2.5 The Metabolic Consequence: Forced Aerobic Glycolysis

Chronic inflammation activates DNA repair pathways such as PARP that consume large amounts of NAD+ to maintain genomic integrity 23. In parallel, inflammatory signaling upregulates CD38, a powerful NADase that accelerates NAD+ degradation and contributes to age- and disease-related NAD+ decline 24. Sustained activation of the kynurenine pathway diverts tryptophan toward quinolinic acid production, altering NAD+ metabolism in a way that is maladaptive under chronic stress conditions 22. Collectively, these processes drive a systemic and central reduction in NAD+ availability that compromises mitochondrial oxidative capacity 14. When forward TCA cycle flux is impaired, cells increasingly rely on aerobic glycolysis despite adequate oxygen supply, a pattern first characterized in proliferating cells and tumors (26). Under these constraints, glutamine and related substrates are rerouted through reductive carboxylation pathways to maintain biosynthetic precursors rather than oxidative ATP production (27). In the context of TRD, this shift helps explain why affected brains show both altered glucose metabolism and functional network disruption in regions implicated in mood regulation and cognitive control (9).



3.3 Mitochondrial Dysfunction and the "Warburg Effect" in the Brain

The term "Warburg Effect" originally described cancer cells' preference for aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation despite oxygen availability (26). Recent work suggests a similar metabolic shift occurs in the depressed brain.



Reductive Carboxylation and the Reverse TCA Cycle:
When the Forward TCA cycle is blocked (due to low NAD+), cells can run the TCA cycle in reverse to generate biosynthetic precursors (e.g., citrate for lipid synthesis, α-Ketoglutarate for amino acid synthesis) (27). This "Reductive Carboxylation" is driven by Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) running in reverse, consuming NADPH.

In the context of TRD, I hypothesize that the brain is attempting to enter a "Growth/Repair" mode (Reverse TCA) to respond to chronic stress, but lacks the energetic capacity (Forward TCA/ATP) to complete the repair. The brain is trapped in a metabolic "limbo"—neither fully oxidizing fuel nor successfully synthesizing new structure. This manifests clinically as the "stuck" phenomenology of TRD: patients are neither acutely suicidal (which requires energy/action) nor able to recover (which requires anabolic growth).


This metabolic limbo is reflected in the core clinical features of treatment-resistant depression. Large longitudinal studies show that a substantial subgroup of patients remain symptomatic despite multiple adequate antidepressant trials, indicating a qualitatively different disease biology rather than simple under-treatment (1). Resting-state connectivity analyses reveal disrupted coordination of large-scale networks that support reward processing, cognitive control, and self-referential thought in major depression (9). Anhedonia—blunted capacity for pleasure—can be understood as a failure of PV+ interneuron-driven gamma synchrony in reward circuits when GABA levels are chronically reduced (12). Repeated spectroscopy studies demonstrate that lower cortical GABA content tracks with greater symptom severity and worse functional outcomes (11). Psychomotor retardation reflects a global downscaling of neuronal activity as the brain attempts to reduce ATP consumption in the face of oxidative failure (4). Patients’ reports of “brain fog” and cognitive fragmentation are consistent with a cortex operating in a disinhibited, noisy state lacking sufficient inhibitory gating (10). Within this framework, poor response to monoaminergic antidepressants follows logically from the fact that receptor-level modulation cannot correct a primary failure of cellular energy metabolism (2).​

3.4 Genetic and Pharmacological Support

Genetic studies provide additional support for our model.

GAD67 Polymorphisms:
Variants in the GAD1 gene (encoding GAD67) have been associated with mood disorders. Postmortem studies of suicide victims show reduced GAD67 mRNA and protein expression in the prefrontal cortex 28. While traditionally attributed to epigenetic silencing, our model suggests that even in the presence of normal GAD67 levels, enzymatic activity may be constrained by substrate (Glutamate) availability due to the stalled GABA Shunt.

Pharmacological Evidence:
Interestingly, drugs that modulate the NAD+/NADH ratio show antidepressant effects in preclinical models. Nicotinamide Riboside (NR), an NAD+ precursor, has been shown to improve mitochondrial function, reduce neuroinflammation, and enhance synaptic plasticity in rodent models of chronic stress 29. Similarly, Ketamine, the rapid-acting antidepressant, bypasses glycolysis by providing ketone bodies (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) that enter the TCA cycle directly as Acetyl-CoA, restoring oxidative flux 30.

4. Therapeutic Implications and Future Directionsf

If Treatment-Resistant Depression is fundamentally a failure of the NAD+-dependent oxidative machinery rather than a receptor deficit, our therapeutic strategy must pivot from "Receptor Modulation" (SSRIs) to "Metabolic Restoration." We propose a three-pronged approach targeting the Redox State, the Metabolic Block, and Mechanical Clearance.

4.1 Restoring the NAD+ Pool: Precursors and CD38 Inhibition

The most direct intervention is to replenish the cytosolic NAD+ pool, thereby restoring the driving force for Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase (SSADH).

NAD+ Precursors:
Supplementation with Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) or Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) has gained traction in aging research but remains underutilized in psychiatry. These precursors bypass the rate-limiting steps of the salvage pathway and rapidly elevate intracellular NAD+ 31. Clinical trials are needed to assess whether high-dose NR/NMN can normalize cerebral lactate levels and restore GABAergic tone in TRD patients.

CD38 and PARP Inhibitors:
Given that inflammation depletes NAD+ via CD38 and PARP overactivation, inhibitors of these enzymes could serve as adjunctive antidepressants. While PARP inhibitors are currently used in oncology, their potential to preserve the brain's energetic reserve in neuroinflammatory conditions warrants investigation 23. Flavonoids such as Apigenin (a CD38 inhibitor) may offer a milder, dietary approach to NAD+ conservation 32.

4.2 Bypassing the Block: Ketones and Succinate

If the glycolytic entry into the TCA cycle (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase) is blocked by Reductive Stress, alternative fuels that bypass this chokepoint may offer relief.

Ketogenic Interventions:

Ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate enter the TCA cycle directly as acetyl-CoA and related intermediates, thereby bypassing glycolysis and pyruvate dehydrogenase entirely (34). This direct fueling of the TCA cycle increases electron flow through the respiratory chain and supports ongoing NADH oxidation back to NAD+, gradually restoring a more oxidized redox state (31). As TCA cycle flux resumes, production of α-ketoglutarate increases, providing the necessary co-substrate for GABA-transaminase in the GABA shunt (19). At the same time, reactivated TCA cycle steps downstream of succinate help relieve pressure on the blocked SSADH step by maintaining overall cycle continuity (18). Experimental work with ketamine and its metabolites shows that interventions altering substrate use and mitochondrial function can produce rapid antidepressant effects, consistent with this type of metabolic reset (30).

Succinate Supplementation:
Succinate enters the TCA cycle downstream of the SSADH block. Providing exogenous succinate could theoretically "back-fill" the cycle, restoring the flux required to clear the accumulated SSA backlog, although blood-brain barrier permeability remains a challenge.

4.3 Mechanical Clearance: The Role of Zone 2 Exercise

Pharmacology alone may be insufficient without structural changes to the brain's metabolic infrastructure.



Zone 2 Training (Lactate Clearance):
Low-intensity, steady-state exercise (Zone 2) specifically targets mitochondrial efficiency and upregulates Monocarboxylate Transporters (MCT1 and MCT4), which are responsible for shuttling lactate between astrocytes and neurons (33).
Mechanism: By forcing predominant use of oxidative metabolism, Zone 2 training stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and increases the activity of key oxidative enzymes such as citrate synthase and other TCA-cycle components (33). Greater mitochondrial content expands the capacity to reoxidize NADH to NAD⁺, progressively shifting the cytosolic redox state toward a more oxidized, energy-efficient profile (14).
Clinical Application: Prescribing “Metabolic Rehab” (Zone 2 training) rather than just “exercise” could be critical. High-intensity exercise (Zone 5) produces more lactate, which a TRD brain cannot clear, potentially worsening the metabolic acidosis. Zone 2 specifically trains the clearance mechanism (33).



4.4 Future Directions

1. Dynamic Metabolic Imaging:
Current evidence relies on static 1H-MRS. Future studies must utilize 13C-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with labeled glucose or lactate tracers to measure the dynamic flux through the GABA Shunt in depressed patients 34. This would definitively confirm the "blocked pipe" hypothesis.

2. Stratification by Metabolic Phenotype:
Not all depression is metabolic. We propose stratifying patients based on Lactate/GABA biomarkers. Patients with "High Lactate/Low GABA" (The Metabolic Subtype) would be candidates for NAD+ therapy and ketogenic interventions, while those with normal metabolic profiles might respond better to traditional monoaminergic agents.

3. The "Two Acidities" Hypothesis:
Future theoretical work should explore the distinction between Respiratory Acidosis CO2-driven, panic-associated) and Metabolic Acidosis (Lactate/Redox-driven, depression-associated). Understanding how the brain buffers these distinct acidic loads could reveal why anxiety often precedes depression (a shift from respiratory compensation to metabolic failure).

5. Conclusion

The failure to treat refractory depression likely stems from a category error: treating a metabolic energy failure as a signaling deficit. The Lactate-GABA Shuttle Hypothesis provides a unified, mechanistic explanation for the paradoxical co-existence of elevated cerebral lactate and reduced GABAergic tone in Treatment-Resistant Depression.

I conclude that TRD represents a state of Systemic Reductive Stress, where a critically low NAD+/NADH ratio blocks the oxidative machinery of the Forward TCA Cycle. This creates a unique form of Metabolic Acidosis (Type 2/Redox Acidity) distinct from the Respiratory Acidosis of anxiety (7). This redox block forces the brain to sequester energy in lactate (anabolic/growth potential) rather than releasing it as GABA (functional inhibition) 20. The "Depressed" brain is not inactive; it is stalled in a high-energy, low-flux state, akin to an engine flooded with fuel but lacking the oxygen to burn it.

By restoring the redox potential via NAD+ precursors 31, bypassing the glycolytic block with ketones 34, and mechanically upregulating clearance via Zone 2 training 33, we can restart the metabolic engine. This paradigm shift moves psychiatry beyond the synapse and into the mitochondria, offering new hope for patients trapped in the metabolic stalemate of depression.
