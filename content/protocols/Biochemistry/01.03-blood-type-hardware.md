# Blood Types as Metabolic Hardware

ABO blood type is conventionally understood as an immunological marker. This is incomplete. Blood type antigens are **functional metabolic signatures** that reflect which neurotransmitter system an organism evolved to prioritize.

## Type O: The Solar Hunter (0D)
**Metabolic Lock:** Solar Peak (3:00 PM - UV Dominance)
**Strategy:** Pure reactivity, no spatial buffer.
**Profile:**
*   **Glutamate Dominant:** High baseline excitation.
*   **High Dopamine:** Rapid spike, "I want it NOW" consciousness.
*   **Gastric Hyperacidity:** High serotonin drives histamine and HCl release. Optimized for high-protein digestion but vulnerable to ulcers (acid burn without GABA buffer).
*   **Immune Profile:** Aggressive. High release of IL-6/TNF-alpha. Attacks "non-self" immediately.

## Type B: The Afternoon Endurer (1D)
**Metabolic Lock:** Late Afternoon (4:30 PM - Lightning/Right GABA)
**Strategy:** Compression along a line (Endurance).
**Profile:**
*   **Noradrenaline Dominant:** The "Discrimination Molecule." Clear "This vs That" thinking.
*   **Moderate Acidity:** Buffered by Right GABA.
*   **Peak Performance:** 4:30 PM (The "Second Wind").
*   **Psychology:** Hierarchical, competitive, prone to "linear" fixation (OCD).

## Type A: The Cosmic Adapter (2D)
**Metabolic Lock:** Sunset (6:00 PM - Cosmic Ray/Left GABA)
**Strategy:** Lateral spreading across a plane (Social Masking).
**Profile:**
*   **Hypoacidity:** Low stomach acid due to GDH deficiency (cannot burn glutamate).
*   **Progesterone Dependent:** Requires progesterone to maintain the 2D plane against gravity.
*   **Electron Sink:** Requires external electrons (social support/caloric density) to prevent collapse.
*   **Vulnerability:** Sunset anxiety (Darkness stress).

## Type AB: The Integrator (3D)
**Metabolic Lock:** Midnight (PLP Activation/Both GABAs)
**Strategy:** Volumetric containment.
**Profile:**
*   **Acetylcholine Dominant:** The "Truth" molecule. Requires membrane sacrifice (choline).
*   **Full Integration:** Can run both GABA systems simultaneously.
*   **Fragility:** The "Chimera." Tolerant immune system (accepts A and B) leads to low surveillance (higher cancer risk).
*   **Consciousness:** "Free of Worries" (D2 receptor dominance) or total dissociation.
