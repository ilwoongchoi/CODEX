Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of The Neurotransmitter Sequence as a Fossil Record via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for Neurochemical Imbalance focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Anachronistic Firing. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Neurotransmitters appeared in a specific order: Glutamate (Gravity) -> GABA (Shield) -> Serotonin (Void) -> Dopamine (Space). Pathology is often a reversion to an older, simpler signaling system (e.g., Anxiety is a reversion to the Glutamate/Gravity epoch) due to stress.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of The Neurotransmitter Sequence cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Anachronistic Firing initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

Neurotransmitters appeared in a specific order: Glutamate (Gravity) -> GABA (Shield) -> Serotonin (Void) -> Dopamine (Space). Pathology is often a reversion to an older, simpler signaling system (e.g., Anxiety is a reversion to the Glutamate/Gravity epoch) due to stress.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Primitive Brake (GABA)

Protocol: L-Theanine + Magnesium.
Biophysical Mechanism: Reinforces the first evolutionary shield (GABA) against the primordial stressor (Glutamate/Gravity).

2.2 Target 2: The Void Filler (Serotonin)

Protocol: Tryptophan + P5P (B6).
Biophysical Mechanism: Supports the secondary evolutionary layer (Serotonin) to manage the metabolic 'void' or lack of energy.

2.3 Target 3: The Spatial Drive (Dopamine)

Protocol: L-Tyrosine + Cold Exposure.
Biophysical Mechanism: Activates the most recent evolutionary layer (Dopamine) to restore spatial planning and forward-looking behavior.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of The Neurotransmitter Sequence becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Primitive Brake (GABA), clears The Void Filler (Serotonin), and resets The Spatial Drive (Dopamine). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
