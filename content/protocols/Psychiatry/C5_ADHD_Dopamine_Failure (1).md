Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of ADHD as a Dopamine Discharge Failure in Type-O Metabolism via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Kinetic Back-Pressure. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Type-O metabolism is a 'Hunter' engine. It generates massive Dopamine for 'Seeking'. If this energy is not discharged kinetically (Movement), it ricochets. The brain spins (Inattention) because the body is stuck. ADHD is not a deficit of attention; it is an excess of undischarged kinetic energy.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of ADHD as a Dopamine Discharge Failure cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Kinetic Back-Pressure initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

Type-O metabolism is a 'Hunter' engine. It generates massive Dopamine for 'Seeking'. If this energy is not discharged kinetically (Movement), it ricochets. The brain spins (Inattention) because the body is stuck. ADHD is not a deficit of attention; it is an excess of undischarged kinetic energy.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Discharge (Movement)

Protocol: Morning Heavy Lifting / Sprinting.
Biophysical Mechanism: Dumps the accumulated Dopamine/Noradrenaline into muscle action, clearing the neural noise for the rest of the day.

2.2 Target 2: The Substrate (Protein)

Protocol: High Protein Breakfast (Tyrosine).
Biophysical Mechanism: Provides the raw amino acids to sustain the high-turnover dopamine production without crashing.

2.3 Target 3: The Focus (Acetylcholine)

Protocol: Alpha-GPC / Nicotine (Micro).
Biophysical Mechanism: Increases Acetylcholine, which acts as the 'Spotlight' to direct the Dopamine 'Floodlight'.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of ADHD as a Dopamine Discharge Failure becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Discharge (Movement), clears The Substrate (Protein), and resets The Focus (Acetylcholine). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
