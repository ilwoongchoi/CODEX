# The Mechanism of Dimensional Collapse

Disease is not random; it is a **Geometric Regression**. When an organism cannot maintain its evolved dimensional state (due to energy/voltage drop), it collapses to a lower dimension.

## 1. Type O Pathology: The 0D Burn
**Mechanism:** Unbuffered Reactivity.
*   **Peptic Ulcers:** Excess serotonin → Excess Histamine → Acid burn. The stomach eats itself because there is no GABAergic "stop" signal.
*   **ADHD:** Dopamine D1 (Urgency) firing without D2 (Spatial) inhibition. The consciousness is trapped in the "Now" point.
*   **Inflammation:** The immune system attacks everything, creating "Friendly Fire" damage (Hashimoto's - though O is distinct from A's autoimmune profile).

## 2. Type B Pathology: The 1D Trap
**Mechanism:** Linear Rigidification.
*   **OCD:** The "Line" cannot be broken. The individual repeats sequences (1D movement) trying to resolve stress.
*   **Depression:** The "Line" breaks. Noradrenaline (forward drive) fails, and because Type B lacks 2D lateral flexibility, they simply stop.
*   **Viral Susceptibility:** "Right GABA" is a specific lock; if a virus picks that lock, the system has no backup.

## 3. Type A Pathology: The 2D Collapse
**Mechanism:** The Electron Sink Fails.
*   **Autoimmunity:** The GDH-deficient cells starve for electrons. They begin "cannibalizing" self-proteins via the Reverse TCA cycle to extract energy. The immune system marks these starving cells for death. It is not a mistake; it is a **metabolic cull**.
*   **Cancer (Gastric):** Low acid allows bacterial overgrowth. The 2D plane (mucosal lining) fails to differentiate.
*   **Anxiety:** Sunset stress triggers a collapse from 2D (Social/Calm) to 0D (Panic) if progesterone is low.

## 4. Type AB Pathology: The 3D Overload
**Mechanism:** Systemic Fragility.
*   **Insomnia:** Acetylcholine synthesis peaks at midnight. If the brain is active then, sleep is impossible.
*   **Psychosis:** The volume of consciousness is too big. They dissociate from the body (0D) entirely.
*   **Gastric Cancer:** The immune system is too tolerant ("Universal Receiver"). It fails to attack early tumors.
