Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Sensory Overload as Stochastic Resonance Failure via Bio-Electric Restoration

# Abstract

Current standard of care for Sensory Processing Disorder (Autism/ADHD) focuses on dampening stimuli, neglecting the underlying noise physics failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Sub-Threshold Signal Loss. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Nerves need a certain level of background noise to fire. This is 'Stochastic Resonance'. If the noise is too low, the signal doesn't cross the threshold. The brain panics and turns up the gain (Volume). Now, EVERYTHING is loud. Sensory Overload is actually a reaction to 'Too Much Silence' in the noise floor.)

# 1. The Biophysical Framework

The pathology of Sensory Overload cannot be understood solely through neurology. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Resonance Dropout initiates a cascade of systemic failure.

Nerves need a certain level of background noise to fire. This is 'Stochastic Resonance'. If the noise is too low, the signal doesn't cross the threshold. The brain panics and turns up the gain (Volume). Now, EVERYTHING is loud. Sensory Overload is actually a reaction to 'Too Much Silence' in the noise floor.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The system, unable to maintain its signal-to-noise ratio, succumbs to feedback screeching. The conventional approach fails because it removes noise (Earplugs/Quiet Rooms), which only forces the brain to turn the gain up higher.

# 2. The Unified Mechanism

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Noise (Pink)

Concept: Pink Noise Therapy.
Universal Mechanism: Introduces a calibrated background hiss (1/f noise). This lifts the weak signals across the threshold via stochastic resonance, allowing the brain to lower its internal gain.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Jitter (Vestibular)

Concept: Whole Body Random Vibration.
Universal Mechanism: Mechanically introduces noise into the proprioceptive system. This helps the body 'find' its limbs in space without having to scream at the muscles.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Threshold (Voltage)

Concept: Magnesium/Calcium Balance.
Universal Mechanism: Adjusts the resting potential of the nerve. By moving the threshold closer to the noise floor, we reduce the amount of external noise needed to trigger a clean signal.

# 3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Isolated Biological Phenomenon' to 'Universal Physics', the resolution of Sensory Overload as Resonance Failure becomes a problem of fundamental topology. The Triad Protocol restores The Noise (Pink), clears The Jitter (Vestibular), and resets The Threshold (Voltage). Once the physical constraints are removed, the system's innate coherence returns.
