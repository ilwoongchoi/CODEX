Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Glioblastoma (GBM) via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for Glioblastoma (GBM) focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Glutamine/Glucose Addiction. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (GBM is the most metabolic of all cancers. It survives on two fuels: Glucose and Glutamine. Standard chemo fails because it doesn't stop the fuel.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Glioblastoma (GBM) cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Glutamine/Glucose Addiction initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

GBM is the most metabolic of all cancers. It survives on two fuels: Glucose and Glutamine. Standard chemo fails because it doesn't stop the fuel.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Pulse (Glucose)

Protocol: Ketogenic Diet + 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2-DG).
Biophysical Mechanism: Starves the tumor of glucose.

2.2 Target 2: The Press (Glutamine)

Protocol: DON (6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) or Green Tea Extract (EGCG).
Biophysical Mechanism: Blocks the Glutamine pathway (Glutaminolysis). EGCG inhibits GDH enzyme.

2.3 Target 3: The Pressure (HBOT)

Protocol: Hyperbaric Oxygen.
Biophysical Mechanism: Reverses the hypoxic drive that makes GBM aggressive.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Glioblastoma (GBM) becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores the The Pulse (Glucose), clears the The Press (Glutamine), and resets the The Pressure (HBOT). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
