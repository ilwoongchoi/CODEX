Keratinocyte Hyper-Proliferation via Th17/IL-23 Axis Dysregulation in Psoriasis

Abstract

Current therapeutic paradigms for Psoriasis often rely on symptomatic pharmacological suppression, overlooking the fundamental biophysical and hydrodynamic determinants of the pathology. This paper proposes a novel mechanistic framework, identifying Rapid Cell Turnover (4 days vs 28 days) as the primary driver of dysregulation. We trace the etiology from the cellular bio-electric disturbance (Redux: Skin cells are growing too fast because the 'Stop' signal is missing. This is often driven by Strep bacteria in the tonsils or gut (Superantigens).) to the systemic phenotype. A targeted Triad Protocol is derived, focusing on the restoration of the Electrolyte Medium, the Hemodynamic/Hydrodynamic Flow, and the Bio-Electric Signal Integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The manifestation of Psoriasis represents a deterministic failure of physiological physics rather than a stochastic biochemical error. Specifically, the mechanism of Rapid Cell Turnover (4 days vs 28 days) initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

Redux: Skin cells are growing too fast because the 'Stop' signal is missing. This is often driven by Strep bacteria in the tonsils or gut (Superantigens).

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. Standard interventions frequently fail to address this upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Clinical resolution requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Trigger (Strep)

Protocol: Berberine + Blis K12 (Oral Probiotic).
Biophysical Mechanism: Targets the Streptococcus reservoir in the gut and throat.

2.2 Target 2: The Turnover (Vitamin D)

Protocol: Topical Vitamin D3 + Sunlight.
Biophysical Mechanism: Vitamin D is the hormone that regulates cell differentiation. It tells the skin cells to 'Slow Down'.

2.3 Target 3: The Liver (Filter)

Protocol: Bile Salts (TUDCA).
Biophysical Mechanism: Psoriasis is often 'Skin Leaky Gut'. If the liver can't filter the toxins, the skin tries to push them out.

3. Conclusion

By re-framing Psoriasis through the lens of Rapid Cell Turnover (4 days vs 28 days), we transition from management to engineering. The Triad Protocol restores the The Trigger (Strep), clears the The Turnover (Vitamin D), and resets the The Liver (Filter). This restoration of the biophysical terrain allows the organism's innate homeostatic mechanisms to resolve the lesion.
