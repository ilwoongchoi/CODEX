PAPER 3: THE ATMOSPHERIC INTERFACE PROTOCOL

Sea Surface Microlayer Modulation and the Global Electric Circuit Re-coupling

Abstract

Ecological restoration at the landscape scale cannot succeed without addressing the atmospheric interface. The Sea Surface Microlayer (SML) and the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) control planetary energy distribution and biogeochemical cycling. We propose that biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) released by restored terrestrial ecosystems alter the SML composition, modifying surface tension and aerosol generation efficiency. This shifts cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and precipitation patterns. Furthermore, by restoring transpiration-driven electrical potential gradients (Ψe), we re-couple the Earth's surface to the ionospheric potential, effectively closing the Global Electric Circuit. This paper demonstrates that ecosystem restoration is fundamentally a geophysical re-tuning operation.

1. The Sea Surface Microlayer as Planetary Boundary

1.1 Surfactant Composition and Gas Transfer Velocity

The SML (thickness 10-100 μm) is enriched in organic surfactants (lipids, proteins, polysaccharides) by factors of 100-1000× relative to bulk seawater. These surfactants reduce surface tension (σ) from ~72 mN/m (pure seawater) to ~50-60 mN/m in situ. The reduced surface tension directly controls the gas transfer velocity (k_gs) for CO2 exchange: k_gs ∝ √(σ). A 25% reduction in surface tension increases CO2 flux by approximately 11% (following the √σ relationship).

1.2 Biogenic VOC Input and Oxidation Products

Restored forests emit biogenic VOCs (primarily isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes) at rates up to 50 μmol/(m²·s). When these compounds reach the SML, they undergo rapid oxidation (primarily by OH radicals and ozone): C10H16 + 3O3 → products including secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors. SOA increases the CCN efficiency of sea spray aerosols by 15-30%, effectively increasing cloud reflectivity (albedo) over marine regions downwind of restored ecosystems.

2. The Global Electric Circuit Re-coupling

2.1 Transpiration-Driven Electrical Potential

Transpiration is fundamentally an electrokinetic process. Water evaporation from leaf surfaces carries cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+) upward, leaving anions (Cl-, NO3-) behind, creating an electrical potential difference: Ψe = (RT/zF) × ln([cations]out / [cations]in). In a mature forest, aggregate transpiration generates electrical potentials of 10-50 V relative to soil ground. This potential couples to the Global Electric Circuit, which maintains an ionospheric potential of +200kV relative to Earth's surface.

2.2 Circuit Closure and Ionospheric Coupling

In a desert (low transpiration), the circuit is effectively "open." The ionospheric charge does not dissipate through the terrestrial surface. This charge imbalance creates enhanced cosmic ray ionization and electrical stress in the upper atmosphere. By restoring transpiration (and thus electrical potential generation), we restore the conduction pathway. The Global Electric Circuit conducts ~1,000 Amperes from ionosphere to Earth's surface, distributed across all thunderstorms and fair-weather areas. Each 1% increase in global transpiration increases circuit conductivity by ~0.01 Siemens.

3. The Atmospheric Feedback Loop

Restored terrestrial ecosystems → Increased BVOC emission → Enhanced CCN in SML → Increased cloud cover & albedo → Reduced surface heating → Enhanced vapor pressure deficit gradient → Increased transpiration → Enhanced electrical potential generation → Improved ionospheric circuit coupling. This creates a positive feedback loop that self-reinforces the transition from arid to mesic conditions.

4. Conclusion: The Atmospheric Closure

Paper 3 closes the atmospheric loop. Papers 1 and 2 restore the terrestrial engine (Water + Soil Chemistry). Paper 3 tunes the atmospheric radiator (Clouds + Electrical Potential). Together, they re-establish the planetary heat engine at higher efficiency.
