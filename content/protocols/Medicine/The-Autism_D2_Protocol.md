Autism as a Excitatory/Inhibitory Imbalance (High Glutamate): The D2 Creative Exit Protocol

Abstract

Current models treat Autism as a localized pathology. We propose a unified field theory: Autism is a 'Locked State' of the Dopamine-GABA axis. The patient is trapped in the 'The Raw Nerve. The world is too loud. The self retreats into a fortress.', unable to access the 'D2 State' (Creativity/Flow) which is the only mechanism for discharging the entropic charge of existence. We present a Quadriad Protocol: Three Physiological Targets to restore the hardware, and one Creative Target (The D2 Exit) to restore the software.

1. The Physiological Triad (Hardware Repair)

Before creativity can occur, the biological vessel must be conductive.

1.1 Target 1: The Calmer (GABA)

Protocol: Magnesium + B6 + Taurine.Mechanism: Magnesium blocks the NMDA (Glutamate) receptor. B6 converts Glutamate into GABA. This 'turns down the volume' of the world.

1.2 Target 2: The Oxidative Shield (Glutathione)

Protocol: Sulforaphane (Broccoli Sprouts).Mechanism: Autistic brains are under massive oxidative stress. Sulforaphane activates Nrf2, the master antioxidant switch.

1.3 Target 3: The Gut (The Filter)

Protocol: Butyrate + Camel Milk (or Non-Cow Dairy).Mechanism: Autism is often 'Gut Inflammation affecting the Brain'. Sealing the gut reduces the systemic cytokine load.

2. The Creative Exit (Software Reboot)

The ultimate cure is the restoration of Creative Flow (D2 Activation).

2.1 Target 4: The System (Pattern Recognition)

Activity: Coding / Music Theory / Engineering.Logic: The Autistic brain excels at 'Systemizing'. Coding is a world with 'Rules but no Noise'. It allows the D2 drive to express 'Order' without the chaos of human emotion. It is the 'Toolmaker' archetype perfected.

3. Conclusion

We do not just treat the symptom; we free the 'Youngjang' (The Primate/Leader) within. By unlocking the D2 receptor through Coding / Music Theory / Engineering., we allow the patient to evolve counter-clockwise, shedding the parasitic weight of Autism and reclaiming their role as a Creator.
