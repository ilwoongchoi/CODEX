Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Long Covid as Spike-Amyloid Fibrinogen Clotting via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

# Abstract

Current standard of care for Long Covid focuses on fatigue, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Amyloidosis of Fibrin. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (The Spike Protein is not just antigenic; it is amyloidogenic. It makes Fibrinogen (clotting protein) fold incorrectly into 'Micro-Clots'. These clots are resistant to normal breakdown (fibrinolysis). They clog the capillaries. Long Covid is asphyxiation at the microscopic level.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

# 1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Long Covid Micro-Clots cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Amyloidosis of Fibrin initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

The Spike Protein is not just antigenic; it is amyloidogenic. It makes Fibrinogen (clotting protein) fold incorrectly into 'Micro-Clots'. These clots are resistant to normal breakdown (fibrinolysis). They clog the capillaries. Long Covid is asphyxiation at the microscopic level.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

# 2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Clot (Nattokinase)

Protocol: Nattokinase (High Dose).
Biophysical Mechanism: Directly degrades the amyloid fibrin, dissolving the micro-clots that standard blood thinners miss.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Binding (Spike)

Protocol: Bromelain + NAC.
Biophysical Mechanism: Cleaves the Spike Protein itself and reduces the disulfide bonds, preventing it from initiating new amyloid formation.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Flow (Zeta)

Protocol: Plasmapheresis (Clinical) or Aspirin (Home).
Biophysical Mechanism: Physically removes the debris or reduces platelet aggregation to restore laminar flow in the capillary bed.

# 3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Long Covid as Spike-Amyloid Clotting becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Clot (Nattokinase), clears The Binding (Spike), and resets The Flow (Zeta). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
