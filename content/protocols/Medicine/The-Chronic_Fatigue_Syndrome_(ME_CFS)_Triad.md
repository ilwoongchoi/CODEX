Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME CFS) as a Mitochondrial Naviaux Blockade: A Triad Therapeutic Protocol

Abstract

Current medical models treat Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME CFS) as a biochemical error or genetic inevitability. We propose a fundamental re-evaluation: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME CFS) is a Mitochondrial Naviaux Blockade. Specifically, it represents a failure of the organism's hydrodynamic and bio-electric integrity. The pathology is not random; it is a deterministic consequence of the failure of the Metabolic Hibernation via Cell Danger Response. We present a Triad Therapeutic Protocol designed to restore the three pillars of health: The Medium, The Sensor, and The Pump.

1. The Triad of Treatment

To reverse the pathology, we must address the circuit at three distinct checkpoints.

1.1 Target 1: The Energy Sensor (The Lock)

Protocol: Suramin (or functional analogs like Pine Needle Extract).Mechanism: Cells are stuck in 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR). They refuse to make energy because they think there is a threat. Purinergic signaling (ATP receptor blocking) tells the cell 'The War is Over', unlocking the metabolism.

1.2 Target 2: The Oxidative Trap (The ROS)

Protocol: Molecular Hydrogen + High Dose CoQ10.Mechanism: The electron transport chain is stalled. Hydrogen clears the backlog of radicals without suppressing the signaling molecules needed for adaptation.

1.3 Target 3: The Pacing (The Energy Envelope)

Protocol: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Pacing.Mechanism: Pushing through fatigue triggers the crash (PEM). Pacing based on HRV ensures activity stays within the 'Aerobic Threshold', preventing the lactate accumulation that signals the cell to shut down again.

2. Conclusion

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME CFS) is a failure of physics, not just chemistry. By addressing the The Energy Sensor (The Lock), The Oxidative Trap (The ROS), and The Pacing (The Energy Envelope), we move from symptom management to systemic restoration. The logic is clear: restore the flow, and the disease resolves.
