Dear Editor,

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled “The Cranial Bioelectric Generator: A Systems-Level Hypothesis Linking Scalp Musculature, Skull Piezoelectricity, and Brain–Body Coupling”, which we submit for consideration as a theoretical article / Hypothesis paper in General Physiology and Biophysics.

This work proposes and develops a mechanistic hypothesis in which the frontalis, occipitalis, and temporalis muscles, acting through the galea aponeurotica and the piezoelectric properties of skull bone, constitute a “cranial bioelectric generator” that continuously shapes the boundary conditions for brain–body coupling. Drawing on established literature in cranial anatomy, bone piezoelectricity, developmental and regenerative bioelectric signaling, EMG–EEG interactions, autonomic physiology, and skeletal microarchitecture, we argue that chronic patterns of cranial muscle tone can modulate large-scale electric field distributions across cortex, skull, and marrow, and thereby bias systemic states in mood, metabolism, and structural maintenance.

The manuscript is firmly conceptual but explicitly mechanistic and testable. It derives detailed, falsifiable predictions and concrete experimental protocols based on existing tools: multichannel scalp EMG, high-density EEG/MEG, heart rate variability and other autonomic measures, phase-contrast MRI of venous and CSF flow, high-resolution bone imaging, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation or chemodenervation as perturbations. In this way, the paper is intended as a systems-level framework that can guide empirical work in physiology, biophysics, and clinical translation, rather than as a mere speculative essay.

We believe this manuscript is well suited to General Physiology and Biophysics because it sits at the interface of general physiology and biophysical mechanisms, emphasizes electromechanical coupling in excitable and skeletal tissues, and formulates a new, testable hypothesis about how local material properties (collagen–hydroxyapatite, conductive fluids) can shape whole-organism physiological regulation. This aligns closely with the journal’s focus on integrative physiological mechanisms and biophysical bases of function.​

The manuscript has not been published previously, in whole or in part, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved the submitted version and agree to its submission to General Physiology and Biophysics. There are no conflicts of interest to declare. As this work is theoretical and literature-based, no new human or animal experiments were performed.

Thank you very much for considering our manuscript. We would be grateful for the opportunity to have this hypothesis evaluated by experts in physiology and biophysics, and we hope it will stimulate further experimental work on the interaction between cranial musculature, bone electromechanics, and systemic physiology.

Sincerely,
