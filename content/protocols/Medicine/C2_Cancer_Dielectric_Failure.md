Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Cancer as a Failure of Dielectric Shielding via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

# Abstract

Current standard of care for Malignancy focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Voltage Drop. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Cancer cells are cells with low membrane voltage (-15mV vs -70mV). They have lost their dielectric charge. To survive this low-voltage state, they revert to fermentation (Warburg Effect) and primitive division. The tumor is not an invader; it is a desperate survival strategy of a de-charged tissue.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

# 1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Cancer as a Failure of Dielectric Shielding cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Voltage Drop initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

Cancer cells are cells with low membrane voltage (-15mV vs -70mV). They have lost their dielectric charge. To survive this low-voltage state, they revert to fermentation (Warburg Effect) and primitive division. The tumor is not an invader; it is a desperate survival strategy of a de-charged tissue.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

# 2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Voltage (Alkalinity)

Protocol: Cesium / Potassium + Bicarbonate.
Biophysical Mechanism: Increases intracellular pH. Alkalinity is synonymous with high voltage (electron donor). This forces the cell out of the fermentation range.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Membrane (Fat)

Protocol: Budwig Diet (Flax + Cottage Cheese).
Biophysical Mechanism: Restores the lipid bilayer's dielectric capacity using sulfur-rich proteins and electron-dense omega-3s, re-charging the capacitor.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Signal (Oxygen)

Protocol: EWOT (Exercise With Oxygen Therapy).
Biophysical Mechanism: Floods the tissue with the electron acceptor (Oxygen), removing the need for the primitive fermentation survival program.

# 3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Cancer as a Failure of Dielectric Shielding becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Voltage (Alkalinity), clears The Membrane (Fat), and resets The Signal (Oxygen). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
