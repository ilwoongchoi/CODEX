Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia) via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia) focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Autonomic Hypovolemia and Baroreceptor Failure. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (POTS is a failure of gravity compensation. Upon standing, 500ml of blood falls to the legs. In health, vasoconstriction pushes it back up. In POTS, the vessels remain flaccid. The heart races (Tachycardia) to compensate for the lack of venous return. It is a 'Plumbing Failure', not a heart defect.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia) cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Autonomic Hypovolemia and Baroreceptor Failure initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

POTS is a failure of gravity compensation. Upon standing, 500ml of blood falls to the legs. In health, vasoconstriction pushes it back up. In POTS, the vessels remain flaccid. The heart races (Tachycardia) to compensate for the lack of venous return. It is a 'Plumbing Failure', not a heart defect.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Volume (Expansion)

Protocol: Salt Loading (5-10g) + Water.
Biophysical Mechanism: Hyper-saline creates osmotic pressure, expanding the total blood volume by up to 1 liter. This fills the 'flaccid pipes' to maintain pressure against gravity.

2.2 Target 2: The Squeeze (Vasoconstriction)

Protocol: Licorice Root (Glycyrrhizin) or Midodrine.
Biophysical Mechanism: Licorice increases cortisol/aldosterone, increasing sodium retention and vascular tone. It mimics the body's natural 'Standing Reflex'.

2.3 Target 3: The Pump (Legs)

Protocol: Recumbent Bike (Horizontal Cardio).
Biophysical Mechanism: Builds the leg muscle pump (Heart #2) without the gravity stress of standing. Stronger calves = Better venous return.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia) becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores the The Volume (Expansion), clears the The Squeeze (Vasoconstriction), and resets the The Pump (Legs). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
