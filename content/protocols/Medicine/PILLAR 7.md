Title: The Thermodynamics of Nutrition: Sodium, Choline, and the Circadian Regulation of Metabolic Voltage.

1. The Sodium Battery (The Shield)

Role: Maintains Blood Volume (Pressure) and Zeta Potential (Charge repulsion).

Protocol: High Sodium Intake (3-6g/day) for Type 2/Shield Phenotypes to prevent "Shield Collapse" (Lupus).

2. The Choline Seal (The Containment)

Role: Synthesis of Acetylcholine (The Truth) and Phospholipids (The Wall).

Protocol: High Choline Intake (Eggs/Liver) for Type 3/Creator Phenotypes to prevent "Leakage" (Teratomas/Cancer).

3. The Carbohydrate Switch (The Timing)

Role: Carbon Source for "Day Burning" (Forward-TCA).

Protocol: Carbs ONLY during Solar Peak (08:00 - 16:00).

Restriction: Zero Carbs after 18:00. Night carbs fuel the "Small Woman's" accumulation error (Fat/Tumor).

4. The Water/Oxygen Ratio (The Bridge)

Role: Oxygen = Day Signal. Hypoxia = Night Signal.

Protocol: Controlled Dehydration at night (Dry Mouth) signals the body to switch to Endogenous Water Production (Fat Burning/Reverse TCA).

Conclusion: Diet is not about calories. It is about Voltage Maintenance. Salt charges the battery. Choline seals the wire. Timing prevents the short circuit.
