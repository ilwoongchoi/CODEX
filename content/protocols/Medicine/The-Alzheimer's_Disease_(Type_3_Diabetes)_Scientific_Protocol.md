Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Alzheimer's Disease (Type 3 Diabetes) via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for Alzheimer's Disease (Type 3 Diabetes) focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Cerebral Insulin Resistance. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (The brain consumes 20% of the body's glucose. In Alzheimer's, the neuronal insulin receptors downregulate (Insulin Resistance). The neurons starve despite high blood sugar. The Beta-Amyloid plaque is not the cause; it is a 'scab' formed to protect the starving neurons from oxidative stress.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Alzheimer's Disease (Type 3 Diabetes) cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Cerebral Insulin Resistance initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

The brain consumes 20% of the body's glucose. In Alzheimer's, the neuronal insulin receptors downregulate (Insulin Resistance). The neurons starve despite high blood sugar. The Beta-Amyloid plaque is not the cause; it is a 'scab' formed to protect the starving neurons from oxidative stress.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Fuel (Ketones)

Protocol: MCT Oil (C8) + Exogenous Ketones.
Biophysical Mechanism: Ketones bypass the broken insulin receptor and cross the Blood-Brain Barrier via the MCT transporter, instantly refueling the starving neurons.

2.2 Target 2: The Plaque (Clearance)

Protocol: Deep Sleep (Glymphatic Flow).
Biophysical Mechanism: The brain only cleans itself during deep sleep (Delta Waves). The Glymphatic system opens up to wash away the Amyloid debris.

2.3 Target 3: The Inflammation (Insulin)

Protocol: Intermittent Fasting (16:8).
Biophysical Mechanism: Lowers systemic insulin levels, re-sensitizing the receptors and stopping the glycation (sugar-rust) of the brain tissue.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Alzheimer's Disease (Type 3 Diabetes) becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores the The Fuel (Ketones), clears the The Plaque (Clearance), and resets the The Inflammation (Insulin). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
