Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript entitled “The Antioxidant Paradox: Pharmacological Disruption of ROS-Mediated Anoikis Signaling Promotes Metastasis in Solid Tumors” for consideration as an review article in Cancer and Metabolism. This work addresses an important and clinically relevant question at the interface of redox biology, cancer metabolism, and metastasis.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are traditionally framed as mutagenic by-products that drive carcinogenesis, which has motivated widespread use of dietary and pharmacologic antioxidants in cancer prevention and care. However, large clinical trials and preclinical models have revealed a paradox: in patients with established solid tumors, antioxidants can fail to improve outcomes and in some contexts appear to increase metastatic burden and mortality. This manuscript proposes a mechanistic, metabolism-focused explanation for this paradox by reframing ROS as a context-dependent “truth signal” that enforces anoikis and ferroptotic checkpoints on detached tumor cells.

The paper integrates data on anoikis, ferroptosis, Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling, BACH1 stabilization, and mitochondrial and choline metabolism to advance the “Antioxidant Paradox” (or “Antioxidant Deception”) hypothesis. In this model, pharmacologic antioxidants suppress the ROS surge that normally accompanies loss of extracellular matrix attachment, thereby stabilizing BACH1, enhancing Nrf2-driven antioxidant and lipid-protective programs, and enabling a regression to an invasive, glycolytic, metastasis-prone state. The work synthesizes disparate findings into a unified framework that yields concrete, testable predictions about when antioxidants may be harmful, and it outlines therapeutic implications such as carefully timed pro-oxidant strategies, ferroptosis sensitization, and targeting the xCT–GSH–GPX4 axis, glutaminase, and choline metabolism in metastatic disease.

This hypothesis-driven synthesis is, in my view, well aligned with Cancer and Metabolism ‘s focus on the metabolic underpinnings of cancer, redox control, and the tumor microenvironment. By explicitly linking ROS signaling, metabolism, and the metastatic bottleneck, the manuscript should be of interest to both basic scientists and translational researchers working on cancer metabolism, ferroptosis, and therapy design. It also speaks directly to an area of ongoing clinical controversy—the safety of antioxidant use in patients with established solid tumors—by providing a mechanistic framework that can guide future experimental and clinical studies.

I confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to Cancer and Metabolism There are no conflicts of interest to declare, and no external funding supported this work.

Thank you for considering this manuscript for publication. I would be grateful for the opportunity to have it evaluated for Cancer and Metabolism
