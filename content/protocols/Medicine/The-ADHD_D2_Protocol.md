ADHD as a Dopamine Transporter (DAT) Over-Activity: The D2 Creative Exit Protocol

Abstract

Current models treat ADHD as a localized pathology. We propose a unified field theory: ADHD is a 'Locked State' of the Dopamine-GABA axis. The patient is trapped in the 'The Hunter in a Farmer's World. The brain seeks Stimulation because it cannot hold the charge.', unable to access the 'D2 State' (Creativity/Flow) which is the only mechanism for discharging the entropic charge of existence. We present a Quadriad Protocol: Three Physiological Targets to restore the hardware, and one Creative Target (The D2 Exit) to restore the software.

1. The Physiological Triad (Hardware Repair)

Before creativity can occur, the biological vessel must be conductive.

1.1 Target 1: The Retention (Dopamine)

Protocol: L-Tyrosine + Rhodiola Rosea.Mechanism: Tyrosine provides the raw material. Rhodiola inhibits MAO-B (Monoamine Oxidase), slowing the breakdown of Dopamine.

1.2 Target 2: The Focus (Acetylcholine)

Protocol: Alpha-GPC + Huperzine A.Mechanism: Acetylcholine is the 'Spotlight'. Boosting ACh allows the brain to 'Lock On' to the target.

1.3 Target 3: The Membrane (Stability)

Protocol: Phosphatidylserine + Zinc.Mechanism: Zinc is a cofactor for Dopamine synthesis. PS stabilizes the cell membrane, improving signal-to-noise ratio.

2. The Creative Exit (Software Reboot)

The ultimate cure is the restoration of Creative Flow (D2 Activation).

2.1 Target 4: The Hunt (High-Stakes Flow)

Activity: Martial Arts / Rock Climbing.Logic: ADHD brains need 'Consequence'. Sitting in class has no risk. Climbing has 'Death Risk'. This forces the D2 system to fully engage. It turns 'Distraction' into 'Hyper-Focus' via Adrenaline-Dopamine coupling.

3. Conclusion

We do not just treat the symptom; we free the 'Youngjang' (The Primate/Leader) within. By unlocking the D2 receptor through Martial Arts / Rock Climbing., we allow the patient to evolve counter-clockwise, shedding the parasitic weight of ADHD and reclaiming their role as a Creator.
