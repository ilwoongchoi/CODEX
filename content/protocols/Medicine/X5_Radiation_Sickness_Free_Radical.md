Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Radiation Sickness as Water Homolysis via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

# Abstract

Current standard of care for Radiation focuses on shielding, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Water Bullet Formation. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Radiation does not hit DNA directly. It hits the Water next to the DNA. It splits H2O into OH* (Hydroxyl Radical). This radical is a bullet. It travels nanometers to smash the DNA. Radiation sickness is essentially acute poisoning by your own water turning into acid/bleach.)

# 1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Radiation Injury cannot be understood solely through particles. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Water Homolysis initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

Radiation does not hit DNA directly. It hits the Water next to the DNA. It splits H2O into OH* (Hydroxyl Radical). This radical is a bullet. It travels nanometers to smash the DNA. Radiation sickness is essentially acute poisoning by your own water turning into acid/bleach.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

# 2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Shield (Hydrogen)

Protocol: Molecular Hydrogen (H2) Gas/Water.
Biophysical Mechanism: H2 is the only antioxidant small enough to penetrate the nucleus and selectively neutralize the OH* radical before it hits the DNA.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Donor (Thiol)

Protocol: Prussian Blue / Glutathione.
Biophysical Mechanism: Donates electrons to quench the radical cascade in the cytoplasm, preserving the organelles.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Recovery (Stem)

Protocol: G-CSF (Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor).
Biophysical Mechanism: Forces the bone marrow to pump out new stem cells to replace the ones sterilized by the oxidative burst.

# 3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Radiation Sickness as Water Homolysis becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Shield (Hydrogen), clears The Donor (Thiol), and resets The Recovery (Stem). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
