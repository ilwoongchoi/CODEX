Quantum Entanglement Residue and Cortical Map Persistence in Phantom Limb Syndrome

# Abstract

The current understanding of Phantom Limb Pain is limited by the classical biochemical model. This paper proposes a Quantum Biophysical Framework, identifying Non-Local Quantum Correlation as the fundamental deviation. We trace the etiology to the sub-atomic scale (The limb is gone, but the 'Bio-Photon Field' of the limb remains entangled with the brain. The brain perceives the 'Ghost' because the quantum information has not been deleted.), where the failure of proton/electron dynamics precipitates the macroscopic phenotype. A Triad Protocol is derived to restore the Quantum Coherence, the Proton Motive Force, and the Bio-Electric Field Integrity.

# 1. Quantum Biophysical Pathophysiology

At the fundamental level, biology is quantum mechanics. Phantom Limb Pain represents a decoherence event or a thermodynamic failure of the Proton (H+) gradient. Specifically, the mechanism of Non-Local Quantum Correlation creates a systemic energy crisis.

The limb is gone, but the 'Bio-Photon Field' of the limb remains entangled with the brain. The brain perceives the 'Ghost' because the quantum information has not been deleted.

This is not merely a 'chemical imbalance' but a 'physics collapse'. The energy that flows from the Big Bang through the mitochondria has been interrupted or diverted, leading to entropic decay (The Scorch) or quantum noise (The Hallucination).

# 2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires intervention at the atomic and field level.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Visual Hack

Protocol: Mirror Box Therapy.
Biophysical Mechanism: Uses visual feedback to collapse the wave function, convincing the brain the limb has moved/relaxed.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Rewrite

Protocol: Graded Motor Imagery.
Biophysical Mechanism: Overwrites the entangled cortical map with new data.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Grounding

Protocol: Faraday Cloth Wrapping (Stump).
Biophysical Mechanism: Shields the stump from external electromagnetic noise that triggers the nerve endings.

# 3. Conclusion

By acknowledging the protonic and quantum nature of Phantom Limb Pain, we move beyond symptom management to energetic restoration. The Triad Protocol reconnects the The Visual Hack, coherentizes the The Rewrite, and stabilizes the The Grounding. Life is flow. We simply remove the resistance.
