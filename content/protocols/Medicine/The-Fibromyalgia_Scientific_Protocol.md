Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Fibromyalgia via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for Fibromyalgia focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Small Fiber Neuropathy & Central Sensitization. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (It is not 'in your head'. 50% of Fibro patients have actual damage to the small nerve fibers in the skin (Neuropathy). The brain turns up the volume (Central Sensitization) to try and hear the damaged signal.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Fibromyalgia cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Small Fiber Neuropathy & Central Sensitization initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

It is not 'in your head'. 50% of Fibro patients have actual damage to the small nerve fibers in the skin (Neuropathy). The brain turns up the volume (Central Sensitization) to try and hear the damaged signal.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Nerve (Repair)

Protocol: Acetyl-L-Carnitine + ALA.
Biophysical Mechanism: Regenerates the small nerve fibers.

2.2 Target 2: The Volume (Gating)

Protocol: Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN).
Biophysical Mechanism: Calms the micro-glial activation in the spinal cord, turning down the pain volume.

2.3 Target 3: The Mitochondria

Protocol: D-Ribose + Magnesium Malate.
Biophysical Mechanism: Fixes the energy deficit in the muscle tissue.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Fibromyalgia becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores the The Nerve (Repair), clears the The Volume (Gating), and resets the The Mitochondria. Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
