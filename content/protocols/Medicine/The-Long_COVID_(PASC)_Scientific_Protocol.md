Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Long COVID (PASC) via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

Abstract

Current standard of care for Long COVID (PASC) focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Viral Persistence and Micro-Clotting. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (The virus (or spike protein) remains in the gut/tissues. It damages the endothelium, causing microscopic clots that block oxygen delivery. The fatigue is cellular suffocation.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Long COVID (PASC) cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Viral Persistence and Micro-Clotting initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction. 

The virus (or spike protein) remains in the gut/tissues. It damages the endothelium, causing microscopic clots that block oxygen delivery. The fatigue is cellular suffocation.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

2.1 Target 1: The Clots (Fibrin)

Protocol: Nattokinase + Serrapeptase (Fibrinolytics).
Biophysical Mechanism: Enzymatically dissolves the 'Amyloid Fibrin' micro-clots, restoring blood flow to the capillaries.

2.2 Target 2: The Immune Reset

Protocol: Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN).
Biophysical Mechanism: Retrains the immune system to stop attacking the host tissues (Microglia modulator).

2.3 Target 3: The Mitochondria

Protocol: Methylene Blue + Red Light.
Biophysical Mechanism: Methylene blue acts as an artificial electron donor, bypassing the viral damage to the mitochondria.

3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Long COVID (PASC) becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores the The Clots (Fibrin), clears the The Immune Reset, and resets the The Mitochondria. Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
