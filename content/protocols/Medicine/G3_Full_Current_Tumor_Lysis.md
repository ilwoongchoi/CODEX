Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of The 'Full Current' Protocol for Tumor Lysis via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

# Abstract

Current standard of care for Solid Tumors focuses on symptomatic suppression, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Hypoxic Isolation. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Tumors are areas of high electrical resistance and low flow. They isolate themselves from the body's 'grid' to survive. The 'Full Current' protocol is not about poisoning the tumor, but about forcing the body's voltage through the blockage, electrocuting the parasite back into submission.) to the systemic manifestation. A Triad Therapeutic Protocol is proposed, targeting the Electrolyte Medium, the Vascular Dynamics, and the Neurological Signal to restore homeostatic integrity.

# 1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Tumor Isolation cannot be understood solely through biochemistry. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Hypoxic Isolation initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

Tumors are areas of high electrical resistance and low flow. They isolate themselves from the body's 'grid' to survive. The 'Full Current' protocol is not about poisoning the tumor, but about forcing the body's voltage through the blockage, electrocuting the parasite back into submission.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

# 2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Voltage (DC)

Protocol: Electro-Acupuncture / High Voltage Pulsed Current.
Biophysical Mechanism: Drives a DC current directly through the tumor site, disrupting the low-voltage fermentation field.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Oxidizer (Ozone)

Protocol: Ozone Therapy / IV Vitamin C.
Biophysical Mechanism: Creates a high-redox potential environment that is incompatible with the tumor's anaerobic survival strategy.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Drain (Lymph)

Protocol: Manual Lymphatic Drainage / Rebounding.
Biophysical Mechanism: Physically clears the necrotic debris created by the lysis, preventing toxic shock from the die-off.

# 3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of The 'Full Current' Protocol becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Voltage (DC), clears The Oxidizer (Ozone), and resets The Drain (Lymph). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
