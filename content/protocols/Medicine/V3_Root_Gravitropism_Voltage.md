Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Remodeling of Root Gravitropism as Auxin Voltage Drift via Bio-Electric and Hydrodynamic Restoration

# Abstract

Current standard of care for Hydroponics focuses on nutrients, neglecting the underlying hydrodynamic and bio-electric failure. This paper elucidates the specific failure mechanism: Statolith Depolarization. We present a mechanistic derivation of pathology, moving from the cellular level (Roots know 'Down' because of heavy starch balls (Statoliths) that sink to the bottom of the cell. This physical impact triggers a Calcium wave and Auxin flow. In microgravity (Space) or poor soil structure, this signal fails. Roots grow wildly. The plant panics.)

# 1. Biophysical Pathophysiology

The pathology of Root Disorientation cannot be understood solely through hormones. It represents a failure of physics. Specifically, the mechanism of Statolith Depolarization initiates a cascade of cellular dysfunction.

Roots know 'Down' because of heavy starch balls (Statoliths) that sink to the bottom of the cell. This physical impact triggers a Calcium wave and Auxin flow. In microgravity (Space) or poor soil structure, this signal fails. Roots grow wildly. The plant panics.

This creates a localized entropy trap. The tissue, unable to maintain its electrical Zeta potential, succumbs to aggregation, stagnation, or hypoxic necrosis. The conventional pharmacological approach often fails because it addresses the downstream chemical receptor without correcting the upstream physical environment.

# 2. The Therapeutic Triad

Restoration requires a simultaneous intervention at three physical checkpoints.

## 2.1 Target 1: The Guide (Field)

Protocol: Electrotropism / DC Field.
Biophysical Mechanism: Roots naturally grow towards the Cathode. Applying a weak electric field can override gravity, guiding roots in space or compact soil.

## 2.2 Target 2: The Flow (Auxin)

Protocol: IBA (Indole-3-butyric acid).
Biophysical Mechanism: Exogenous rooting hormone restores the polarity of the tissue, creating a chemical 'Down' even if the physical 'Down' is missing.

## 2.3 Target 3: The Sensor (Calcium)

Protocol: Calcium Silicate.
Biophysical Mechanism: Strengthens the cell wall and ensures the calcium signaling wave can propagate efficiently when the statoliths hit.

# 3. Conclusion

By shifting the lens from 'Idiopathic Pathology' to 'Deterministic Physics', the resolution of Root Disorientation as Voltage Drift becomes an engineering problem. The Triad Protocol restores The Guide (Field), clears The Flow (Auxin), and resets The Sensor (Calcium). Once the physical constraints are removed, the organism's innate regenerative capacity resolves the lesion.
