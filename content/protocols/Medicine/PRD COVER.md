Subject: Submission of manuscript “Galactic Rotation Curves as Macroscopic Quantum Vortices: A Superfluid Vacuum Solution to the Dark Matter Problem”

Dear Editors,

Please find attached our manuscript entitled “Galactic Rotation Curves as Macroscopic Quantum Vortices: A Superfluid Vacuum Solution to the Dark Matter Problem" for consideration as a Regular Article in Physical Review D.

In this work, we propose a novel physical mechanism for the flatness of galactic rotation curves based on a superfluid vortex description within the framework of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive the characteristic MOND acceleration scale analytically and demonstrate that it naturally emerges from the vortex dynamics of the galactic medium.

To validate this theoretical model, we performed numerical simulations that reproduce the rotation curves of observed galaxies. A key strength of this study is its full reproducibility; the Python source code and simulation algorithms used to generate our results have been archived and made publicly available via Zenodo.

We believe this work is particularly relevant to the readership of Physical Review D as it addresses the fundamental problem of dark matter and modified gravity, offering a new perspective on galactic kinematics.

This manuscript is the authors' original work and has not been published nor has it been submitted simultaneously elsewhere. We have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript.

Sincerely,

IL WOONG CHOI
